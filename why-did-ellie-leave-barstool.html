Because people are staying indoors, working from home, and traveling less, they're consuming more content than ever before. It's also drawn more eyes to not just the web pages and videos these sites churn out, but their business practices too.</p><p>This is something <a href=#>Barstool Sports</a> is no stranger to with its recent list of departures, which is why fans are asking why Ellie left the platform.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Why did Ellie Schnitt leave 'Barstool'?</h2><p>The Schnitt Talk podcast was a popular program for the sports media site, both Ellie and co-host Alanna Vizzoni resonated with fans and managed to garner a decent sized viewership that received a push from the site. However, Ellie had recently announced that Schnitt Talk would be having its final episode and that she would not only be leaving the show but Barstool too.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Ellie announced the news on Twitter, stating that she's looking forward to the next step in her career, but didn't divulge any reason as to why she was departing from the online sports giant. All she said was that she had made the decision to leave Barstool Sports, while thanking everyone she worked with over the past few years for her personal growth and development. So what happened?</p><p>There have been several notable personalities who have left the platform recently, like Trillz. Many believe that the departures are tied to some of the more controversial things the site's founder, Dave Portnoy, has said in the past during various segments.</p><p>However, there's no way to know if Ellie's decision to leave Barstool is tied to Dave Portnoy, but that hasn't stopped people on the internet from speculating.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr>hi 👉👈 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lcnZeWdEvQ</a></p>— ellie schnitt (@holy_schnitt) <a href=#>September 8, 2020</a></figure><p>Some people are happy that she's parted ways with the website, stating that it was akin to someone dumping a crumby ex-boyfriend while others weren't really "buying" that she decided to leave to pursue other career opportunities.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i’m so sad ellie is leaving barstool 😭 my fav podcast, the reason i love pink whitney and the blow brush 💔</p>— ßrianna🌹 (@xbriiibriiix) <a href=#>September 9, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ellie Schnitt leaving Barstool is the career equivalent of girls dumping their racist boyfriends.

She vowed to be as active as she was previously online and has made good on that promise.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>as someone who loves ellie but despises barstool i have never been happier cheers queen let’s gooooooo <a href=#>https://t.co/McIPgzR7RY</a></p>— lana (@alana_delrey__) <a href=#>September 8, 2020</a></figure><p>Dave Portnoy, for all his criticism, has also managed to veer off into the world of finance commentary in which he's attaining some legitimate success. The Barstool founder and internet personality is making some legitimate gains in stocks and is sharing his experience with his fans. Oh, and not to mention that he was able to land a one-on-one interview with President Trump where he opened by bringing up the fact he could sniff out Ali G was a fake from the get-go.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2adnKG2pnnLnpivnV2XrrO%2F06impQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-ellie-leave-barstool.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-ellie-leave-barstool.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-ellie-leave-barstool.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-ellie-leave-barstool.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-ellie-leave-barstool.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-ellie-leave-barstool.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./burt-young-career-earnings-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./burt-young-career-earnings-and-net-worth.html>Burt Young career earnings and net worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-the-richest-real-housewife-of-dallas.html>Who Is The Richest Real Housewife Of Dallas?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-the-richest-real-housewife-of-dallas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
