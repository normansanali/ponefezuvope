The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television.</p><p>Kauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the (catchy) working title Insomnia Caf√© between November and December 1993.

Littlefield noted an undertone of anger to Bierko's performance, which helped to eliminate him from consideration.</p><p>"The attractive leading man who you love and can do comedy is very rare," said Littlefield.
