The 24-year-old recently had surgery to remove a tumor in her ovary. She is soon to be receiving chemotherapy.</p><p>Besides, Catton has a pretty upsetting story to tell as her condition was ignored by doctors both in England and Australia. Many told her the symptoms of pain, bloating, and diarrhea was from the stress due to menstruation.</p><p>A doctor crossed a barrier of human decency when she told Catton that she was overweight. Such body shaming by someone as prestigious as a doctor comes as a tragic surprise for everyone.
