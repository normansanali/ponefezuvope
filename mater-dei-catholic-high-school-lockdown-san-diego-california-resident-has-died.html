The Chula Vista police department quickly declared on Twitter that a student had taken a massage gun to school, but that there was no substantial threat from the event. On Thursday, Mater Dei Catholic High School was placed on lockdown for the second time in two days after a gun was spotted on campus. However, the purported gun was actually a massage gun. Chula Vista police officers arrived at the school.</p><p>According to Lt. Scott Adkins of the Chula Vista Police Department, the school was placed on lockdown for “just minutes” until officers realized the weapon in question was a massage gun, commonly known as a percussion massager. According to photographs seen online, these gadgets resemble a space-age rifle with a massive ball on the end. According to Adkins, a teacher overheard a student making a joke about a massage gun and reported the incident to the school office shortly after 8:50 a.m. The school was placed into lockdown, and the police were called.</p><p>According to Adkins, a law enforcement officer from the local area went to the classroom and determined that the alarm was false. According to him, the lockdown was removed within five minutes. According to Adkins, the instructor most likely simply heard the term “gun” and called the office, adding, “I don’t know if the teacher even saw it. According to the police, the incident was a misunderstanding and was not being treated as a crime. The organization also indicated that it was being forwarded to school administrators.</p><p>It was the second time in the last week that someone reported a gun on campus. The school was placed on lockdown on Wednesday after a caller claimed that there was an active shooter. According to the police, the call was later discovered to be a forgery. At around 1:00 p.m., a person called the Chula Vista police department from a number from outside of the state to report that he was being held in a classroom with other individuals and that other persons in the vicinity had been injured. He further indicated that he had seen two people on campus who were armed with weapons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwucCtnKtllJq2bq%2FArZ%2BopJmYeqm1xqFkrJuYpLytecuomqScn6y7br%2FAp2SdoZWcvG6vwKWgn6eio7aiedGeqqKclaPBbrTArGSdoZWZfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmater-dei-catholic-high-school-lockdown-san-diego-california-resident-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmater-dei-catholic-high-school-lockdown-san-diego-california-resident-has-died.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmater-dei-catholic-high-school-lockdown-san-diego-california-resident-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmater-dei-catholic-high-school-lockdown-san-diego-california-resident-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmater-dei-catholic-high-school-lockdown-san-diego-california-resident-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmater-dei-catholic-high-school-lockdown-san-diego-california-resident-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./matthew-perry-turned-down-his-role-on-friends.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./matthew-perry-turned-down-his-role-on-friends.html>Matthew Perry Initially Turned Down His Role On Friends And Coached Another Actor For The Part Inste</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./joss-stone.html>Joss Stone Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./joss-stone.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
