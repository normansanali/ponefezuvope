Born on March 14, 1992, Kailyn is currently 27 years of age. Her mother, Suzanne Irwin, raised her.</p><p>While her high school is unknown, we assume that she attended a local school at Honesdale. In Contrast, we know Kailyn graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mass communications from Delaware State University in the year 2017. It is unknown if she graduated high school or not, but she definitely got some certification to join college.</p><p>Kailyn got pregnant for the first time when she was only 16 years old while in high school. Her family was against the pregnancy, and the boyfriend also bailed out. Consequently, Kailyn aborted the child unwillingly. But a year later, she got pregnant again at the age of 17.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dating_Life_with_Second_Baby_Daddy_%E2%80%98Jo_Rivera></span>Dating Life with Second Baby Daddy ‘Jo’ Rivera<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the name of the first boy who impregnated her when she was 16 is a secret, father to her second pregnancy is Jonathan ‘Jo’ Rivera. At age 17, Kaylin got impregnated by her then-boyfriend Jonathan. Kaylin, against her family’s will, decided to keep the child and gave birth to her first son on January 18, 2010.</p><p>Kaylin had moved out of her house due to her family, not supporting her decision. This was also when she joined the MTV original show, 16 and Pregnant.&nbsp;Her first child’s name is Isaac Elliott Rivera. Despite having a child with Jonathan, the relationship between Kaylin and <i>Jo</i> didn’t work out, and they broke up.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16837 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/eceleb-gossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kailyn-Lowry-ex-jonathan.jpg alt="Image of Kailyn Lowry with her first boyfriend Jonathan 'Jo' Rivera" width=600 height=484 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-16837 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Kailyn Lowry with her first boyfriend Jonathan ‘Jo’ Rivera</strong></p><p>Kaylin was still living in the Rivera’s family home after breaking up with Jonathan as she had nowhere to go. But once Kaylin started dating her co-worker Jordan, she had to move out of the house. Her fling with Jordan didn’t even last a few months.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marriage_and_Divorce_with_Javi_Marroquin></span>Marriage and Divorce with Javi Marroquin<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After moving on from Jonathan and Jordan, Lowry started dating <a href=#><strong>Javi Marroquin</strong></a> in the year 2011.

Due to their irreconcilable differences and Javi cheating on Kailyn, she filed for divorce two years into her marriage. Shortly after, they started living separately. Teen Mom 2&nbsp;shooting was going on during this process.</p><p>Javi and Kailyn had also tried to mend the marriage, which got broken beyond repair. They had been on the show Marriage Boot Camp, but their divorce finalized in October of the year 2016 before the episode aired.</p><p>Kailyn is very unhappy with Javi and has remarked about not marrying Javi Marroquin under any circumstances. In the podcast, she also talked about the scuffle that Javi and Lauren had because of Javi’s sister Lidia, where cops were also called. Kailyn claims, she was called over eight times in the middle of the night when that incident happened.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Secret_Dating_Life_with_Latest_Babby_Dady_Chris_Lopez></span>Secret Dating Life with Latest Babby Dady Chris Lopez<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kailyn’s latest flame is her long-time friend Chris Lopez who is her youngest baby-daddy.

But, let us go through her income first.</p><p>Kailyn approximately makes <strong>$35k</strong> per episode from Teen Mom 2, which is by no means a small number. This takes her income per season, being at the range of <strong>$400k</strong>. Besides the earnings from the show, Kailyn has a staggering 3.8 million followers in Instagram and earns roughly <strong>$100k</strong> yearly from promoting brans in her Instagram.<br>With the revenue from her book sales and podcast, we can say that her yearly income is over <strong>$200k</strong>.</p><p>Lowry, with such a vast yearly income, has a net worth reflecting on her income. Her estimated net worth is $2 million, which is definitely a small fortune. While we might consider it a small fortune, the fact she rose to that from having nothing is impressive. Her net worth is likely to increase with time as well, as her book sales and her Instagram followers increase.</p><p>Kaylin’s fame is the primary source of her income.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Facts_about_Kailyn_Lowry></span>Quick Facts about Kailyn Lowry<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table style=border-collapse:collapse;width:100%><tbody><tr><td style=width:50%>Name</td><td style=width:50%>Kailyn Lowry</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Date of Birth</td><td style=width:50%>March 14, 1992</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Occupation</td><td style=width:50%>TV personality<br>Public Speaker<br>Author</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Relationship status</td><td style=width:50%>Single</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Previous Partners</td><td style=width:50%><li>unnamed baby daddy</li><li>Jonathan Rivera</li><li>Javi Marroquin</li><li>Chris Lopez</li></td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Spouse</td><td style=width:50%>Ex-husband Javi Rivera</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Children</td><td style=width:50%>Three<br>Isaac Elliott Rivera (With Jonathan Rivera)<br>Lincoln Marshall Marroquin (With Javi Marroquin)<br>Lux Russel Lowry (With Chris Lopez)</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Net Worth</td><td style=width:50%>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Height</td><td style=width:50%>1.71m (5ft 7.5inches)</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Zodiac Sign</td><td style=width:50%>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Body Measurement</td><td style=width:50%>35-28-36</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq6MoKasq5mle6S7zGiimqGcrrtuuM6wqbJllJbBqrrGZpmosZantqa6w2alnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkailyn-lowry-dating-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkailyn-lowry-dating-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkailyn-lowry-dating-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkailyn-lowry-dating-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkailyn-lowry-dating-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkailyn-lowry-dating-boyfriend-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-danielle-brownwiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-danielle-brownwiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html>Who is Danielle Brown? | Wiki, Age, Bio, Net Worth, Career, Relationship,Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./223658-see-what-bo-derek-had-say-her-relationsh-html.html>See What Bo Derek Had to Say about Her Relationship with 18-Year Partner John Corbett in a Recent In</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./223658-see-what-bo-derek-had-say-her-relationsh-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
