It has to be a significant disruption to the educational mission of the school in order for the school to regulate the student’s speech,” said Zansberg, who is not representing the family.</p><p>“And I’m deeply skeptical that that’s true here,” he added.</p><p>A school administrator told Rodriguez that her son could not display the patch because of the flag’s “origins with slavery and the slave trade,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video of a meeting</a> between them shows.</p><p>The mom argued the Gadsden flag’s origins can actually be traced to the Revolutionary War and not slavery — but the school also claimed the seventh-grader violated dress code policy with other patches, including some displaying firearms.</p><p>Rodriguez praised her son for standing up for his beliefs and protecting his rights.</p><p>“I’m proud that he just chose the hard route,” she said of the “very stressful” experience.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The school said the seventh-grader had other patches depicting semi-automatic weapons. <span class=credit>Twitter / @cboyack</span></figure><p>The Vanguard School cited the national media coverage of the story in a statement but noted that “the story is incomplete.”</p><p>“The patch in question was part of half a dozen other patches of semi-automatic weapons. The student has removed the semi-automatic patches,” it said.</p><p>“As a school district, we will continue to ensure all students and employees can learn and work in a safe and nurturing environment. The student returned to class without incident after removing the patches of semi-automatic weapons from the backpack,” the school added.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Gadsden flag was first used by the US’s first naval commander-in-chief as a personal ensign during the American Revolution, according to Britannica. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Democratic Gov. Jared Polis defended Jaiden.</p><p>“The Gadsden flag is a proud symbol of the American Revolution and an iconic warning to Britain or any government not to violate the liberties of Americans,” Polis tweeted in response to the video.</p><p>“It appears on popular American medallions and challenge coins through today and Ben Franklin also adopted it to symbolize the union of the 13 colonies. It’s a great teaching moment for a history lesson!” he added.</p><p>The flag was first used by Commodore Esek Hopkins, the country’s first naval commander-in-chief, as a personal ensign during the American Revolution, according to Britannica.</p><p>It has been adopted by the conservative Tea Party movement and has become increasingly associated with right-wing politics.</p><p>In 2016, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that the flag itself is not a racist symbol but is “sometimes interpreted to convey racially tinged messages in some contexts” while investigating a US Postal Service employee complaint about a co-worker wearing a hat with the flag.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmbGhforyuec6fZKyspZmyr8CMpKCco5WZerDB02amr52iYrOtrcZmmqWZmaLAbrXTZq2ip5yWwaawjKGgrGWWnr%2B0wIyapJ6mlKKyr8CMq6CgoKSofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmom-of-student-kicked-out-over-flag-claims-it-violated-his-first-amendment-rights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmom-of-student-kicked-out-over-flag-claims-it-violated-his-first-amendment-rights.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmom-of-student-kicked-out-over-flag-claims-it-violated-his-first-amendment-rights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmom-of-student-kicked-out-over-flag-claims-it-violated-his-first-amendment-rights.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmom-of-student-kicked-out-over-flag-claims-it-violated-his-first-amendment-rights.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmom-of-student-kicked-out-over-flag-claims-it-violated-his-first-amendment-rights.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./miranda-hart-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./miranda-hart-biography.html>Miranda Hart biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ahsan-khan-baby-girl.html>Meet Ahsan Khan Baby Girl, Daughter, Marriage Date, Wife Fatima Khan, Age Know Everything About Ahsa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ahsan-khan-baby-girl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
