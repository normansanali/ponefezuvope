Whether it's a star <a href=#>talking about their hit shows</a>, talking about <a href=#>their personal lives</a>, or talking about <a href=#>people they spent years working with</a>, fans love hearing what stars have to say.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Connelly has been in Hollywood for decades, and she's had plenty to say through the years. The star worked with David Bowie on Labyrinth, and she's opened up about working with the iconic rocker several times.</p><p>Let's hear what Jennifer Connelly had to say about working with David Bowie back in the '80s.</p><h2 id=jennifer-connelly-has-had-a-successful-career>Jennifer Connelly Has Had A Successful Career</h2><p>Since the 1980s, Jennifer Connelly has been a fixture in the world of film. Her career has endured for decades thanks to what she can bring to any project, and this is precisely why she is still landing in smash hits to this very day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans got familiar with the actress back in the 1980s, and she had several successful movies that decade that propelled her to a successful run in the 1990s. This trend continued into the 2000s, and even now, Connelly is still making big things happen.</p><p>Not only did she voice Karen in Spider-Man: Homecoming, but she recently stared in Top Gun: Maverick, which just crossed the $1 billion mark at the box office.</p><p>It's genuinely amazing to see what Jennifer Connelly continues to accomplish in her career, especially with how long it's been.</p><p>Back in the '80s, as she was making a name for herself, the actress starred in a Jim Henson feature that became a classic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Pete Davidson's Mom Has Said About His Famous Girlfriends</a></span></p><h2 id=she-starred-in-39-labyrinth-39-with-david-bowie>She Starred In 'Labyrinth' With David Bowie</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1986, Jennifer Connelly starred in a little film called Labyrinth, which has since gone down as a classic. The movie paired her with David Bowie, who was already an icon in the world of music. This was a genius pairing by Jim Henson, and the duo helped turned the film into a gem.</p><p>Though not a hit at the box office, the film has endured for decades thanks to its incredible puppet work, its stunning visuals, and its soundtrack, courtesy of David Bowie.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New Statesmen</a> wrote a piece on Bowie's time in the film, and they had an excellent section about the star's performance.</p><p>"For many fans, Labyrinth was their first encounter with Bowie – not on some hoary old rock LPs their dad liked, but in a fantastically sinister adventure tale in which he funnels his ambiguity, his magnetism and his subtle disquiet into Jareth: ridiculous and camp, true, but still threatening. The performance is hammy but somehow pitched absolutely right for the world it inhabits, crystallising his weirdo iconoclasm. Bowie gives Jareth a dark sexuality that we (and Jennifer Connelly’s 16-year-old protagonist Sarah) are drawn to as much as we’re repulsed," the site wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike many of her younger peers, Connelly was not aware of how important her co-star was in the world of music.</p><p>"I wasn't cool enough to get what working with him really meant. It was probably a good thing that I wasn't," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Graham Norton</a>.</p><p>Naturally, many people have wondered what Connelly thought of Bowie while they worked together all those year ago.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s What Mike Myers Said About Working With Beyoncé</a></span></p><h2 id=what-she-said-about-working-with-him>What She Said About Working With Him</h2><p>So, what did Jennifer Connelly have to say about working with David Bowie on Labyrinth? Based on her words, the actress had a good experience with the rock icon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He was funny and gracious and made me feel so comfortable. He was amazing. Subsequently I became a huge fan of his music."</p><p>As we mentioned already, Connelly was not aware of how much of a musical giant Bowie was before working with him, but eventually, she got into his music, which increased her appreciation of Bowie.</p><p>"After working with him, he became a real hero of mine because he was so kind to me — I was a 14-year-old kid and knew nothing," she said.</p><p>The actress has not opened up about David Bowie often, but she's always had some great words for him.</p><p>When speaking with ET after his passing, Connelly had some kind words for her former co-star.</p><p>"It's very sad, his passing, for so many reasons. To me, not only was he a genius, he was a genius who had the time to be kind. [That] was my experience of him," she said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Gwyneth Paltrow's Husband Has Said About Living With Her</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's great to learn that Jennifer Connelly had a positive experience working with David Bowie on Labyrinth. The film itself is a classic, but this bit of information helps makes it even better.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Mike Myers Said This About The Future Of “Shrek”</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYremus2inZ6qXZi8r7rEpaOyZaOWtqV5wJumrqxdrLyzt8innmavmam1brDAr6CdZZKkxKqxjKilZqSRl8aztc2tn2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-jennifer-connelly-said-about-working-with-david-bowie-on-labyrinth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-jennifer-connelly-said-about-working-with-david-bowie-on-labyrinth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-jennifer-connelly-said-about-working-with-david-bowie-on-labyrinth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-jennifer-connelly-said-about-working-with-david-bowie-on-labyrinth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-jennifer-connelly-said-about-working-with-david-bowie-on-labyrinth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-jennifer-connelly-said-about-working-with-david-bowie-on-labyrinth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aliyah-drops-mind-blowing-pink-bikini-photo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aliyah-drops-mind-blowing-pink-bikini-photo.html>Aliyah Drops Mind-Blowing Pink Bikini Photo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rick-hoffman-net-worth-in-2023-how-rich-is-he-now-html.html>Rick Hoffman Net Worth in 2024 | How Rich is He Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rick-hoffman-net-worth-in-2023-how-rich-is-he-now-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
