You might think that you’re being encouraging, but all you’re really doing is reminding them that they’ll never see a sunrise again — and if they did, they’d burst into flames and turn into a pile of dust, which is probably worse than whatever else is going on in their immortal lives at the time. Although that’s debatable, as a few members of Staten Island’s most elite vampire household might prefer a second death to the guilt, loneliness, failure, and loss they’re feeling at the end of this week’s penultimate episode. How bad is it, you ask? So bad, Nandor’s taking responsibility for his actions. Yeah …</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5u0s000q3b6v91wgg5et@published data-word-count=118>The episode starts on a hopeful note, as we finally find out who Guillermo was FaceTiming with earlier in the season. As expected, it’s a special someone, a British auction-house employee and art history enthusiast named Freddie. Guillermo and Freddie got pretty serious during that lost year in London, so much so that they’re still unabashedly referring to each other as “boyfriends” despite living on opposite sides of the Atlantic. (No fuckboy throat-clearing here, yet another of Freddie’s positive qualities.) That being said, despite the progress he’s been making in this area — coming out to his family was huge — Guillermo is still engaging in his worst habits when it comes to Freddie: namely, lying and deception.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5u45000r3b6v40fqp1cc@published data-word-count=133>Freddie is his first-ever real boyfriend, so I get it. The stakes are high. (No pun intended.) And telling your partner that “lol, guess what, I don’t actually work for the U.N., I’m a vampire’s familiar” is difficult — not least because they have to wrap their head around the existence of vampires (and your desire to become one) before they can even begin processing a year’s worth of subterfuge. But the lies were bound to backfire eventually, even if Freddie hadn’t shown up unannounced on the vampires’ doorstep, opening a Pandora’s box both with Freddie and Nandor, who had no idea that Guillermo had met someone. (I’m even less inclined to tsk-tsk Guillermo on this one, as not saying what they really mean is at the core of his and Nandor’s dynamic.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5u7i000t3b6v8p930x09@published data-word-count=151>Nandor’s actions in this episode are both the cruelest and the most mature things he’s done over the course of this entire series. Treating Marwa like an undead paper doll was bad enough, but at least she was zonked out on djinn hypnotism and didn’t really get what was going on. That’s a violation of consent, to be sure. But it’s a kindness compared to canoodling with the living (ish — are clones really alive?) sublimation of Nandor’s hurt feelings at Guillermo falling for someone else. It’s especially bad to keep doing so after the actual Freddie goes back to England, taunting Guillermo not only with his love’s absence, but also with Nandor’s power over him. It’s petty and manipulative and just plain mean, and I really felt for Guillermo when he was about to burst into tears on the front steps of the mansion toward the end of the episode.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd84gu001r3b6vpa3enenp@published data-word-count=166>So mean, in fact, that it forces Nandor to be honest with himself for once and let Freddie/Marwa go, even though they do look good together nestled naked under furs next to a roaring fire. What happens next is, in a way, a happy ending for Marwa, who gets to be with someone who actually likes her for once — although she has to literally become someone else to get that love, which is very sad if you think about it. It’s also deeply hurtful to poor Guillermo, of course, who is probably going to have a hard time forgiving both Nandor and Freddie for the way things went down. (I would.) It’s also also a pretty astute joke about gay guys dating someone who looks exactly like them, a phenomenon I’ve heard referred to as “boyfriend twins.” Whether they will eventually learn, as Nandor has, that “true love is more than wishing for someone who likes all the things you like” remains to be seen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5ub5000u3b6vo6it04n9@published data-word-count=160>But while Guillermo and Nandor’s actions are rooted in long-standing tensions between the two of them, I had a harder time wrapping my head around Laszlo deliberately tanking Nadja’s by taking Baby Colin away from her and the club. True, he’s been a bit of a stage dad ever since Baby Colin’s talent for creepy child song-and-dance was revealed earlier in the season. But suddenly deciding to aggressively renegotiate the boy’s contract felt like more of a slight against Nadja — who’s a real mess throughout most of the episode, as she is every time she’s separated from her beloved — than advocating for Colin, who doesn’t really want to go on tour anyway. Or perhaps it’s about his ego. But if he wants to join Colin’s act as more than an accompanist, or feels that Nadja is paying too much attention to the club and not enough attention to him, he should just say so. Use your words, Lazslo!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5ueh000v3b6v824d62ft@published data-word-count=109>The plan backfires, anyway, as Mark Prosch returns to the show in body as well as in face. Watching Colin go through puberty in fast-forward was one of the more amusing parts of this overall quite melancholy episode (well, that and The Clown Who Can Suck Himself Off, who I thought was going to be French, although his ultimate accent was arguably funnier). Ever willing to make himself look silly for the sake of comedy, Prosch put on those tiny clothes that made his stomach pooch out like a champ, sticking little bits of toilet paper on his face and slamming doors and screaming about Papa Roach and Evanescence.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5ui4000w3b6vlu55ws5s@published data-word-count=118>Everyone seems to know that Colin’s growth spurt marks the end of an era, however, the seriousness of which isn’t really revealed until Laszlo and Adolescent Colin return to the club at the end of the episode. There’s shame on Colin’s face when he sees how shocked and upset Nadja is at his appearance — more than the usual amount of teenage shame. And while Laszlo makes a weak attempt at making it up to Nadja by telling her about this amazing clown with a talent for autofellatio he heard about on the road, it’s not enough to save the club. They’ve run out of options. Her dream is dead. And not even Laszlo seems happy about it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5ul4000x3b6v8zpcxs6c@published data-word-count=93>As the poignant guitar solo from Derek and the Dominos’ “Layla” plays over the closing scenes, everyone in our core cast is at a personal low. I’ve been trying to think of another episode of the show as poignant and sad as this one, and the only thing I can come up with is the penultimate episode of last season, after Colin Robinson 1.0 died and before he was reborn as the precocious Baby Colin. What will be reborn amid the ashes of season four? We’ve got one more episode to find out.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl7gd5u4f000s3b6vxjl0lqjq@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Craven Mirth</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5uog000y3b6vsm7chkun@published data-word-count=58>• Bringing in Sofia Coppola; her real-life husband, Thomas Mars (singer of the French indie-pop band Phoenix, if you’re not familiar); and Jim Jarmusch for the “celebrity special” bit had a real “who’s in Toronto this week?” kind of energy, rather like the Sesame Street “<a href=#>Put Down the Duckie</a>” video from the ’80s that’s been circulating on Twitter.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5uwi000z3b6vq40fpqzk@published data-word-count=49>• Unlike Coppola, Jarmusch has made a vampire movie (2013’s Only Lovers Left Alive with Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston), so he gets to live. Even that joke ended on a sad note, though, as poor Jim will figure out that those weren’t exceptionally realistic practical effects soon enough.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5uzq00103b6va4c0cnl9@published data-word-count=29>• I also appreciated the literal “eat the rich” energy of them only ripping the heads off of celebrities who could afford a $5,000 menu item.

I do very much believe that Matt Berry could have gone on, and that the crew were standing just offscreen holding in their laughter the entire time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5vkq00153b6v3pmkq40i@published data-word-count=24>• Free ice 24/7 probably is very impressive if you come from 18th-century England.

Her blood-drunk Nadja was full of hilarious details: the blood smeared all over her mouth; the sleepy, half-closed eyes; the outbursts, the slumped posture, the pratfalls; calling herself “Mama.” But the best part, in my humble opinion, was her pronunciation of “Sofia Cappabala.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl7gd5vuk00183b6ve3ewy59t@published data-word-count=37>• But hey, at least she looked great: The black jumpsuit with red and white spangles and the chiffon bustle was one of my all-time favorite Nadja looks.
