Upon reaching there, they caught a 42-year-old man near Arnold Close Street.</p><p>However, the police were told that there is another suspect who jumped into an SUV and headed to Noblet Street. An officer along with his dog, Rusty, went to chase the burglar on foot and they found the man riding an SUV around 4 AM.</p><p>When the police officer confronted the man, he pulled out a screwdriver and tried to attack him with it. He allegedly made multiple attempts to stab the officer but Rusty, the dog, saved him by biting off the burglar. The officer received a minor injury to his hand in the incident.</p><figure class="aligncenter size-full"></figure><p>Fortunately, the officer’s dog, Rusty, saved himself from the screwdriver attack by biting the burglar.

It’s believed the person who did the heinous act of stabbing a defenseless being with a sharp object was a burglar.</p><p>After distressing countless netizens, the video was taken down from social media platforms. The latest act is being confused with the above-shared incident of the police dog Rusty who got stabbed in the eye with a screwdriver by a burglar.</p><p><a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://fb.watch/koWsPc1JuN/?mibextid=Nif5oz" rel="noopener noreferrer">check video here</a></p><p>However, the two incidents are reportedly different. We have tried looking up the video for our readers but it has been taken down. There is no point in searching for the same.

If you know anything important about the incident, please share it in the comments, so the necessary action could be taken against the monstrous person.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p>One tweet claims that the dog passed away after getting stabbed with a screwdriver. The user paid respect to the dog by writing RIP and praying for its well-being. However, it’s not confirmed if the report is true or simply made up.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p>Recently, such distressing acts against animals are on the rise. Just a few days ago, a gore-filled video of a cat in a blender went viral on Twitter, Reddit, and other social media platforms. Unfortunately, the cat died in the incident.</p><p>If you find any such acts online or offline, please report them to the dedicated authorities. Animals are innocent and they must be saved from such heartless acts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminqJyusb%2BNqKmgZ6CkuaqvxGabqJ9dqMGirsGem2avmam1bq2MrJqrnaeZv6rCxKtkmp6kmr9uwNGyoKefXam8br%2FAr5xmoJmoeqmtzZ2jnqpf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpolice-dog-stabbed-with-a-screwdriver-after-trying-to-save-his-handler.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpolice-dog-stabbed-with-a-screwdriver-after-trying-to-save-his-handler.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpolice-dog-stabbed-with-a-screwdriver-after-trying-to-save-his-handler.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpolice-dog-stabbed-with-a-screwdriver-after-trying-to-save-his-handler.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpolice-dog-stabbed-with-a-screwdriver-after-trying-to-save-his-handler.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpolice-dog-stabbed-with-a-screwdriver-after-trying-to-save-his-handler.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rihanna-records-sexually-explicit-songs-with-chris-brown-3-years-after-assault-2012212.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rihanna-records-sexually-explicit-songs-with-chris-brown-3-years-after-assault-2012212.html>Rihanna Records Sexually Explicit Songs With Chris Brown 3 Years After Assault</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paul-pierces-accumulated-wealth.html>Paul Pierces Accumulated Wealth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./paul-pierces-accumulated-wealth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
