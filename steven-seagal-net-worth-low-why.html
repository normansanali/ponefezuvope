However, he has two projects in pre-production, which means that it looks like <strong>Seagal is getting ready for a comeback to the big screen</strong>. This is not why Seagal is making news though. Instead, it is because Seagal was spotted at Vladimir Putin's inauguration on May 7, 2024. Seagal is an ally of Putin's and has been since <strong>becoming a Russian citizen in 2016</strong>. Since then, Seagal has served as a "special representative" to the US and Japan.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-steven-seagal-worth-today>How Much Is Steven Seagal Worth Today?</h2><h3 id=net-worth-14-million>Net Worth: $14 million</h3><h2><img alt="Steven Seagal " data-image-id=253140 data-mobile-optimized=true height=598 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/screenshot-2024-03-06-at-3-00-36-pm.png width=914 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>Given his huge list of accolades, especially in the TV space, most would assume that Steven Seagal would have a surging net worth these days, in the category of $100 million and above. However, this could not be further from the truth, as <strong>the actor is currently worth $14 million</strong>.</p><p>In truth, given his reputation, we don't see this number climbing much higher and, given some controversies he was involved in, it might shrink even further. This is especially notable, as Steven Seagal was once making millions for roles, including <strong>$6.5 million for both Exit Wounds and Ticker</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, what really hurt Seagal's career was <strong>his reputation behind the scenes</strong>.

It was said that Steven had an ego and was very close-minded when it came to ideas.</p><p>In truth, that was only the beginning of his downfall, as additional factors would contribute to his net worth plummeting. Steven Seagal went from starring in <strong>a film that earned $83.5 million domestically</strong> (Under Siege), and another<strong> $73 million overseas</strong>, <a href=#>for a total of <strong>$156.5 million</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=why-did-steven-seagal-39-s-net-worth-plummet-in-recent-years>Why Did Steven Seagal's Net Worth Plummet In Recent Years?</h2><h3 id=steven-seagal-stopped-making-films-in-2019-and-entered-into-some-poor-business-deals>Steven Seagal stopped making films in 2019 and entered into some poor business deals</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2><img alt="Steven Seagal " data-image-id=253144 data-mobile-optimized=true height=566 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/screenshot-2024-03-06-at-3-00-56-pm.png width=888 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>Steven Seagal has made some questionable decisions throughout his career. That includes entering businesses outside of acting, like his <strong>energy drink Steven Seagal's Lightning Bolt in 2005</strong>, which would eventually be discontinued. Steven Seagal claimed that he backpacked Asia to find the best ingredients for his energy drink, making mention that the drink offered an "untold power". He also endorsed failed products like a knife range along with aftershave creams.</p><p>In 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seagal lost more money thanks to his promotion of Bitcoiin2Gen</a>. The actor kept vital information a secret, including his large pay to endorse the product, which was valued at <strong>a cool million</strong>. Once this came out, he was forced to fork over <strong>six figures in penalties</strong>.</p><p>Ultimately, his biggest downfall was due to acting. Getting employed became a tough task, not only because actors spoke out against his behavior, but also because women such as Regina Simons, Julianna Margulies, and Portia De Rossi took to the public and discussed stories of abuse from the actor.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/steven-seagal-broke-sean-connery-s-bone-and-did-long-term-damage-to-the-hollywood-legend-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Steven Seagal Immediately Walked Out Of His BBC Interview After Assault And Harassment Topics From His Past Were Brought Up</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Even before BBC interviewer Kirsty Wark could finish her question about harassment, Steven Seagal was off his chair and gone from the interview.</span><p>In fact, Portia De Rossi took to Twitter, discussing her experience alongside the once famous actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My final audition for a Steven Segal movie took place in his office</a> .
