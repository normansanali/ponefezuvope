In 2003 JaMarcus started attending Louisiana State University, where of course, he continued playing American football. During the year at university he not only became more experienced but also improved his skills even more. He added a lot to the winning performances of his teams and proved that he was a really talented football player. In 2007 JaMarcus became a part of the team called the “Oakland Raiders”. This had a huge influence on the growth of Russell’s net worth. Despite successful games, Russell experienced some injuries and was not able to play for some time. In the 2008 season Russell gained more trust from the coach of the “Oakland Raiders” and played as the starter. First games of the season were not very successful for JaMarcus and his team, and because of his poor game Russell had to spend much of his time on a bench in that season, and in the 2009 season. One year later JaMarcus left the “Oakland Riders” and his career as an American football player also ended.
