Apart from creating and editing YouTube videos, Adam is also passionate about skateboarding and other sports. Moreover, he owns two cats.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43990 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Adam-Montoya-cat.jpg alt="Adam Montoya" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43990 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Adam Montoya featuring his cat in his YouTube videos. Source: Pinterest</p><h2><span id=Adam_Montoya_8211_Net_Worth_2024>Adam Montoya – Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>As coming to his earnings and net worth, he surely pockets a handsome amount of money through his profession. He has a <strong>net worth</strong> of around $4 million as of 2023.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>He commentated on games that he played with other commentators including VanossGaming, Markiplier, and Tom Cassell. He frequently collaborated with GassyMexican, TheGamingTerroriser, Chilled Chaos, Mr. Sark, Uncle Slam, Mangaminx/TheRPGMinx, Hutch, Cathy Diep, BryceGames, RitzPlays, and Tejbz. Moreover, on February 5, 2016, Montoya announced that he would voice Taskmaster in the mobile app game Marvel Avengers Academy.</p><p>Moreover, his gaming YouTube channel ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SeaNanners Gaming Channe</a>l’ has mustered more than 5.42 million subscribers to date.</p><h4>In detail</h4><p>After graduating from San Diego State, instead of finding stable employment, Montoya did freelance work such as filming weddings. At that time, Adam, finding inspiration from other early YouTube gaming commentators, decided to record and upload his game commentaries.</p><p>Adam created a channel named ‘SeaNanners Gaming Channel’ on March 3, 2009. After the channel gained initial hype for his ‘Call of Duty’ commentaries, he eventually switched gears to PC games and ‘Minecraft’ which now stands as the number one reason for his success. However, with tons of gaming video uploads that fetched him enough fame to make his channel popular among gaming buffs, Adam quit Machinima.com to focus on his newfound career.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline>Work with Machinima and&nbsp;</span><span id=JETPAK class=mw-headline>JETPAK</span></h4><p>Montoya uploaded a video on December 3, 2009, to his channel explaining that he was now partnered with Machinima Inc. And that they would post gameplay videos of his to their network channel. Similarly, on June 14, 2010, Montoya posted a video to his channel stating that he was a full-time employee of Machinima.</p><p>Montoya announced that he and his associates had launched an MCN, JETPAK, on November 5, 2014. Therefore, he wanted to create a network that did not contractually take advantage of YouTubers and their channels. The MCN is operated by former Machinima employees.</p><h4>The Paranormal Action Squad</h4><p>On November 2, 2016, Montoya announced he would co-star with Scott Robison and Evan Fong in a new YouTube Red original series, The Paranormal Action Squad. The animated comedy aired on November 16, 2016. Therefore, the show is an animated adult comedy starring Eddie, Paul, and Vanoss with Michael Rowe, of Futurama fame, behind the show’s writing. This is YouTube Red’s 12th original series.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43991 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Adam-Montoya-frns.jpg alt="Adam Montoya" width=650 height=613 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43991 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Adam Montoya clicking a photo with other gamers.

He also made only one tweet in 2018, a huge departure from his previous steady rate of at least one tweet per week. Adam has not officially stated anything about a permanent retirement, but in guest appearances on friends’ videos, he has discussed taking a break from YouTube and video creation to get “passive income up and running, whether I’m doing this or doing that […] looking heavily into real estate”.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Speaking of his relationship, he is dating a girl named <strong>Cathy Diep</strong>. They started dating in 2011. Even though their relationship was initially kept secretive, Cathy soon started appearing in many of his videos. Cathy is a YouTube gamer and also has a gaming YouTube channel called ‘Catabot’, where Adam is seen as a frequent guest. The duo keeps featuring themselves on their respective Instagram posts. However, they are having a good time and are enjoying their life together.</p><p>Similarly, he has maintained a clean public profile that is away from rumors, scandals, and controversies that might hamper his professional or personal life. He is currently focusing on his career and is developing his skills at the moment.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43992 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Adam-Montoya-gf.jpg alt="Adam Montoya" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43992 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Adam Montoya clicking a selfie with his girlfriend.
