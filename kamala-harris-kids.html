The former couple married in 1992 but parted ways amicably after 16 years of marriage. (Kerstin even helped out during Harris's presidential campaign.) Before Emhoff met Harris, he wasn't very vocal about his dating life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"First I was a little blindsided, to be honest," Cole recalled to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.glamour.com/story/doug-emhoff-cole-and-ella-emhoff-zoom-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Glamour class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Glamour</a>, of his first impression of Emhoff and Harris's relationship. "Doug was like, 'I met this woman. She's cool. I'm excited about her.' And Doug hadn't talked about his dating life for a long time.

I was like, 'Okay, cool, whatever.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cole was in high school at the time his dad and then Attorney General Harris started seeing each other.

And I realized like, Oh, my God, Doug has met someone who is completely unique and totally special.

It felt serious when [Doug] was just talking about her, because I could hear it in his voice. When we did meet, it all felt so natural that it wasn't even a big deal. It felt like we had known each other forever. And I think what was important was getting to know her as a person first—a person before a politician."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even then, Harris was wearing her signature Converse and jeans.

"And I was determined not to insert myself in their lives until Doug and I had established we were in this for the long haul. Children need consistency; I didn't want to insert myself into their lives as a temporary fixture because I didn't want to disappoint them."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added, "So, we took it slow, and Doug and I put a lot of thought into when and how I would first meet the kids."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The big meeting happened at a seafood restaurant on the Pacific Coast Highway, Reel Inn. "On my way to meet Doug, I picked up a tin of cookies and tied a ribbon in a bow around them," Harris recalled. "I took a few deep breaths. I was excited, and I was nervous. I rehearsed what I would say."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But in the end, Harris had nothing to worry about. "Cole and Ella could not have been more welcoming," she wrote. "They are brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults. I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in."</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Cole and Ella coined the term, "Momala."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"A few years later when Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom.' Instead they came up with the name 'Momala,'" Harris wrote for ELLE. She also brought up the term of endearment throughout her campaign when speaking about her kids. "Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who as you just heard, call me Momala," she said while <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a33650592/kamala-harris-2020-democratic-national-convention/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="accepting the nomination for vice president" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">accepting the nomination for vice president</a> at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ella even mentioned the nickname while introducing Harris in a video for the DNC. "To my brother and me, you'll always be Momala, the world's greatest stepmom," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Emhoff kids have grown up since their time first meeting Harris in high school.

"Fortunately for me, both Ella and Cole do get it. They are my endless source of love and pure joy," Harris also wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their signature bonding activity is Sunday dinner. "We come together, all of us around the table, and over time we've fallen into our roles. Cole sets the table and picks the music, Ella makes beautiful desserts, Doug acts as my sous-chef, and I cook," Harris added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The dinner discussion would sometimes get intense and intellectual during these meals. "We would just have these real conversations at dinner, almost Socratic, where we would all bounce off each other," Cole recalled to Glamour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When they're not together, Harris likes to keep in touch by leaving voicemails, not text messages. "It'll just be something sweet like, 'Hi, I was just thinking about you, hope your day is good,'" Ella told Glamour. "And then I call back!"</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">They stay close with weekly Zoom calls.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harris, Emhoff, and their kids also have family Zoom calls every weekend, which were helpful for staying close while the future VP was on the campaign trail, and while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. "We have a Sunday Zoom, and we talk during the week," Emhoff told Glamour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a35172207/kamala-harris-doug-emhoff-zoom-video/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Videos shared with ELLE" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Videos shared with ELLE</a> and CBS Sunday Morning reveal moments from their virtual, family-wide gatherings, which also include parents, grandparents, cousins, aunts, and uncles.
