Those are among our favorites of 2024 so far: Megan Thee Stallion’s incendiary “Hiss,” a heartfelt country song from Beyoncé, Charli XCX and ScHoolboy Q’s glorious returns to form.

He sang about being a “beat-down rodeo clown” and literally falling on his face on his 2022 breakout, Boat Songs; even “Dan Marino” focused on the Hall of Fame quarterback being replaced by Tom Brady on the Wheaties box. On “She’s Leaving You,” Lenderman has never made failure sound so good. His character is a sleazy faker who loves<strong> </strong>Clapton<strong> </strong>and Vegas and, as the title suggests, can’t keep a woman around. Not the kind of guy you might want to be singing about —&nbsp;until you hear that roaring chorus: “It falls apart / We all got work to do.” Cap it off with a coarse, Crazy Horse–esque guitar solo and you’ve got a winner of a song. <strong>—</strong>Justin Curto</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cly60q3j7000p3b8wpyv0vi8t@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Put Em in the Fridge,” Peso Pluma feat.

So on “Put Em in the Fridge,” he takes on one of pop’s biggest challenges by going toe-to-toe with Cardi B. Amazingly, he holds his own, spitting threats to his enemies and even rapping the hook in English, over a corrido-goes-trap<strong> </strong>beat full of squealing horns. Peso’s presence challenges<strong> </strong>Cardi, too, as she raps her best Spanglish verse yet (“En Jalisco ven mi culo y dicen, ‘Diablo, Cardi’” goes hard in any language). It’s an unrelenting two and a half minutes, and both performers come out bigger stars than before. —J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cly60sz2s000z3b8wi0tcohw7@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Please Please Please,” Sabrina Carpenter</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cly60tndv00153b8wafou7mjd@published data-word-count=110><a href=#>“Espresso</a>” finally has some <a href=#>song-of-summer competition</a> — from Sabrina Carpenter herself.<strong> </strong>“Please Please Please,” the rising star’s follow-up, is somehow breezier and weirder than (and completely different from) her undeniable<strong> </strong>dance-pop hit.<strong> </strong>Carpenter plays a 21st-century Olivia Newton-John on the sun-kissed pop-country–ish<strong> </strong>song, pleading with a lover to not embarrass her. She packs the song with silly quotables with help from “Espresso” co-writer Amy Allen: “I know you’re cravin’ some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice,” she sings with the pep of a cheerleader. And just like “Espresso,” this one’s all momentum too: Carpenter sticks the landing on a thrilling second-verse key change and Swiftian outro.<strong> </strong>—J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clx1xyr8q000e3b7hw9h4ba16@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Death & Romance,” Magdalena Bay</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx1y06jv000m3b7he80z5kxg@published data-word-count=115>For the first few years of their career, Magdalena Bay were overeager <a href=#>students of pop music</a>, stuffing their music with styles and homages. Now, they’re quickly becoming masters themselves. “Death & Romance,” the presumed leadoff to a new album, is denser and sleeker than anything off their debut, Mercurial World. A house piano line grows into a full kaleidoscopic track, flourished with twinkly synths and groovy bass. The duo hasn’t lost their prog-rock roots, though, as Mica Tenenbaum sings from the perspective of a woman whose alien boyfriend has left her. The hook splits the difference between a perfect pop earworm and a prog declaration: “You know nothing is fair in death and romance.” —J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clx1yah73001b3b7hhcvy09mr@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Pink Skies,” Zach Bryan</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx1y36cr000y3b7hipuk5sjx@published data-word-count=110>Zach Bryan is a matter-of-fact narrator for most of “Pink Skies,” setting a funeral (presumably for his late mother, DeAnn, whom he previously named a 2019 album after) to banjo and harmonica, before raising his voice for one striking line: “I bet God heard you coming!”<strong> </strong>But “Pink Skies” is mostly a testament to a life that continues to echo on earth. Throughout the song, other memories rush back. Cleaning the house, Bryan sees childhood height markings on the wall, and the smell of the grass transports him to the day someone broke their arm on a swing. Bryan knows how loudly these moments speak, so he lets them. —J.C.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx1zvwto003e3b7h1z4tjtqt@published data-word-count=12>➽&nbsp;Read Justin Curto on <a href=#>the country music being made outside of Nashville</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clx1ybviz001h3b7ha3ul8aif@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Hang Tight Honey,” Lainey Wilson</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx1y3251000v3b7hkaw2qtos@published data-word-count=86>Lainey Wilson <a href=#>played</a> an unbelievable 180 shows last year. Thankfully, she’s got quite a bit to show for it — some No. 1 singles, two Entertainer of the Year trophies, and now, “Hang Tight Honey,” a steamy new love song dressed up as a road song. “Just know they’re singin’ along to all them songs I wrote about you,” Wilson sings with a smirk, before screaming guitars rev “Honey” into its overdrive chorus. She’s going to burn up more than a few stages with this.<strong> </strong>—J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clx1yuoeq00223b7h1v8murnl@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Lunch,” Billie Eilish</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx1yuxzt00253b7hqwn7un1g@published data-word-count=105>Billie Eilish didn’t release singles ahead of her third album, <a href=#>Hit Me Hard and Soft</a>, but she was hiding an obvious one in plain sight. With “Lunch,” Eilish gives one of her coolest performances yet, gliding over an ’80s New Wave–ish groove as she sings about a girl who seems, well, good enough to eat. “Taking pictures in the mirror / Oh my God, her skin’s so clear / Tell her, ‘Bring that over here,’” sings Eilish, balancing wide-eyed eagerness with sexy nonchalance. “Lunch” made headlines as Eilish’s first track about being with a woman, but beneath that, it’s just a charged-up pop song. —J.C.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx1zd7uq003a3b7h9m7wbnde@published data-word-count=12>➽<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Read Craig Jenkins’s <a href=#>review of Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clx1yknuc001s3b7h4pdiv4zl@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Delphinium Blue,” Cassandra Jenkins</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx1yoifm001y3b7hf2u3x0uy@published data-word-count=102>Cassandra Jenkins recites the spoken hook to “Delphinium Blue” with an entrancing, eerie swagger, like she could be anything from a gang lackey to a housewife: “Chin up / Stay on task / Wash the windows / Count the cash.” Really, she’s working at a flower shop, as the title gives away.<strong> </strong>It’s a job Jenkins actually took, in a moment of confusion. But her daily duties began to feel mythic, she said, like she “was surrounded by a Greek chorus.” She translates that feeling to song on “Delphinium Blue,” backed by a plodding, cinematic track and, yes, even a choir. —J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clx1z1gcv002c3b7hykdckz59@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Old Dutch,” Bonny Light Horseman</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx1z3dyg002j3b7h8n5mhmo6@published data-word-count=92>“Old Dutch,” from folk supergroup Bonny Light Horseman, is about two lovers struggling to verbalize their terrifyingly big feelings. “You know that you move me and I don’t know why,” sings Eric Johnson, best known for his indie-folk project Fruit Bats. The song doesn’t build toward any epiphany or resolution — instead, Bonny Light Horseman wants to make listeners feel the same way. So near the fourth minute, Johnson’s howl gives way to a singing crowd, recorded live in an Irish pub where the band tracked half their new double album.<strong> </strong>—J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clx1z92qg00303b7hu60g66g2@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“The Last Year,” Jessica Pratt</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx1z9ppm00363b7h6qii9mym@published data-word-count=92>Like the rest of her new album,&nbsp;Here in the Pitch, Jessica Pratt’s “The Last Year” feels like a visit from an old daydream —&nbsp;sweet, wistful, a tad melancholic. Over a gentle guitar riff and smokey reverb plucked straight from a ’60s soul track, she sings of a hopeful future: “You’d wonder if ever there’s been hope for me / I think it’s gonna be fine / I think we’re gonna be together / And the storyline goes forever.” In an era of recycled culture, Pratt’s vintage approach sounds refreshingly alive. —Alex Suskind</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clx2069u7003i3b7ho9p8p71u@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Love Me Not,” Ravyn Lenae</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx207des003o3b7hp414udtm@published data-word-count=75>Ravyn Lenae’s early standouts like “Sticky” and “Free Room” were full of youthful playfulness — after all, the singer was only a teenager when she recorded them. After exploring a more mature,<a href=#> sultry sound on 2022’s Hypnos</a>, she finds that levity again on “Love Me Not,” with help from a playground game. The single is springy throwback R&B: crisp drums, sly bass, and a good dose of reverb set against Lenae’s classically trained voice.<strong> </strong>—J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clvo3lf4z000c3b8efnrmz81n@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Baddy on the Floor,” Jamie xx feat.

When most listeners hear Divine Styler’s boisterous hip-hop track “Ain’t Sayin’ Nothin’,” they gravitate toward that squealing horn, sampled from Motown’s Junior Walker and later made famous in House of Pain’s “Jump Around.” Not Jamie. He takes a few stray bars from Styler’s first verse and mashes, stretches, and loops them into the hook of this slick dance track: “Move your body on the floor.” With the blessing of house evangelist Honey Dijon and some slick piano and horns from Keni Burke’s forgotten “Let Somebody Love You,” that command becomes easy to follow. Where Jamie’s recent singles like “It’s So Good” have been dense and intricate constructions, “Baddy” shows that sometimes, just a few perfect sounds can be transportive. —J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clvo3z0af000o3b8egl1dnyvo@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Comin’ Around Again,” Amber Mark (April 5)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvo418q7000y3b8e14nrpfo7@published data-word-count=88>Amber Mark’s first solo follow-up to her debut album is feel-good music to the max. Mark blends high-gloss turn-of-the-century R&B with a joyous gospel piano line and sunny Motown-esque songwriting for a love song that feels fresh yet genuinely timeless. (Okay, minus the one line about cell phones.) She’s maturing as a lyricist too, trading the clichés that could weigh down 2022’s Three Dimensions Deep for satisfying concision on lines like, “Let’s take it easy, no diamond, no pressure.” Falling in love has never sounded so smooth. —J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clvo4b26b00153b8eri39yjap@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Self Sabotage,” Katie Pruitt</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvo4bavn001b3b8evfy1kjzn@published data-word-count=107>Katie Pruitt directs her most penetrating lyrics at herself. “I wish my head had a trapdoor / For when I need escaping,” she opens her song “Self Sabotage.” An early peak to Pruitt’s second album, Mantras, the song faces the negative thought patterns that inspired the record head-on. The anthem builds from a whimper to a full-throated cry, amplified by wailing electric guitars and pounding drums: “I’m not some narcissistic God / Abandon this self-sabotage.” Pruitt may fashion herself a folky country singer in the vein of her hero Brandi Carlile, but here she sounds closer to the exposed indie-rock songs of Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus.—J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clulekele001i3b81rn025ifp@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Cheerleader,” Porter Robinson</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clulenlfa001w3b81ys4phn5n@published data-word-count=80>Porter Robinson has grown a lot in three years. His last album, 2021’s Nurture, was marked by anxiety over following up his 2014 debut — a weight he carried for years before channeling it into a collection of explosive, life-affirming songs. On “Cheerleader,” the first single off a new album, Robinson sounds like he’s having fun again. It’s a slick turn from EDM to indie pop, like a Passion Pit song went to a rave: bubbly, bright, and loud. —J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clull7n0200d13b81n68tb563@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Get It Sexyy,” Sexyy Red</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clull84a500d73b815fp1qj8s@published data-word-count=64>Who’s writing better hooks right now than Sexyy Red? Over a brooding Tay Keith beat, the St. Louis rapper becomes her own cheerleader: “Walkin’ through the club lookin’ like a snack (But you knew that though)”; “Catch me slidin’ in a Benz”; “Go on, Sexyy, do your dance.” Like “SkeeYee” and “PoundTown” (and “Hellcat SRTs” and “Rich Babby Daddy”), everything here is quotable. —A.S.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clulek4f400103b81b7fm880u@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Classical,” Vampire Weekend</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cluler0pr00253b810dphua64@published data-word-count=129>Vampire Weekend can rewind to 2008 with just one sound. A few seconds into “Classical,” a riff drops in that sounds like a harpsichord, immediately transporting you back to quirky early cuts like “M79.” But that’s a fake out. Listen closer, and the harpsichord is actually a guitar riff, distorted like many of the other instruments on Only God Was Above Us. “Classical” pulls from other Vampire Weekend eras too: the jaunty acoustic guitar from Father of the Bride, the pensive politics of Modern Vampires of the City. It builds up to something new for the band: a chaotic, free-jazzy breakdown. “It’s clear something’s gonna change / And when it does, which classical remains?,” Ezra Koenig wonders. For Vampire Weekend, the answer is a little bit of everything. —J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clvo4fjs0001i3b8e93358gt0@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Symptom of Life,” Willow</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvo4fn96001o3b8eu0qgz19j@published data-word-count=53>Willow’s artistry is one of adaptability — a flexible performer who can flip between alt-R&B jams, nü-metal covers, and scratchy pop-punk with ease.

She goes for middle-of-the-road pop gloss when her major-label contract is up and makes a song for the biggest movie of the year, then she returns with a breezy, sleazy club track that she played at the Boiler Room. “Von Dutch” is an immediate hit of the messy Charli we’d been missing since 2017’s Pop 2, pushed from zero to 100 and then into overdrive. “Von Dutch, cult classic but I still pop,” she says, over the dirtiest synths you ever did hear. —J.C.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clulflrxq004e3b818dx2kdi0@published data-word-count=11>➽Read Jason Frank’s <a href=#>scene report from Charli XCX’s Boiler Room set</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clx20te59003s3b7hf94yyw1u@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Peacekeeper,” 1010benja</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clx20uv3m00423b7hbvebcbwx@published data-word-count=42>“Peacekeeper” is one of the many genre-mashing magic tricks producer-singer-rapper 1010benja pulls off on <a href=#>his spectacular debut album,&nbsp;Ten Total</a>.

After an epic journey of freight-train-hopping, sleeping on trash piles, and ducking the cops in Nebraska, they’re ready to take it all in. “We’ll get lost in a city forgotten / ’Cause I don’t like change / And I hate good-byes.”&nbsp;—A.S.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvo4m2h2002u3b8eeoxoftc5@published data-word-count=8>➽ Read Jenn Pelly’s <a href=#>profile of Alynda Segarra</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clvo4rkg800373b8e8pq9o0bx@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Yearn 101,” ScHoolboy Q</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvo4s3f3003j3b8eztkaeuzi@published data-word-count=57>The aggrieved ScHoolboy Q fans who spent the last five years begging for new music (hi, it’s me) can finally shut up now that the rapper&nbsp;dropped <a href=#>his sprawling new record</a>,&nbsp;Blue Lips.

Though she took a long, winding path to get there — she began her career making punk music with her sister Allison —&nbsp;she still has that rocker’s spirit, just with a bit more twang now. “My spine’s a rotted two-by-four,” she cries, over a wall of guitars. (MJ Lenderman, from the Southern punk band Wednesday, plays on the track.) Telling the story of a messy split from a friend, Crutchfield chooses her words carefully: “I get bored,” she repeats, the line becoming more cutting each time. —J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clulfuqa7005f3b81gn0v8yv7@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“16 Carriages,” Beyoncé</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clulfvfcv005o3b81esn5hsa9@published data-word-count=126><a href=#>On “16 Carriages,”</a> Beyoncé tackles the sort of track that country artists have been cutting for decades: a road song. “At 15, the innocence was gone astray / Had to leave my home at an early age,” she sings, remembering her first tour with Destiny’s Child. Beyoncé fashions herself as the weary troubadour, reminding fans that her glamorous life didn’t come without sacrifice. It’s the most Beyoncé has opened up on a record in years, and it’s no coincidence that it’s on a country ballad — her own three chords and the truth. Robert Randolph’s resounding steel guitar adds a touch of Southern gospel, while Bey brings some soulful riffing throughout. To paraphrase her, “16 Carriages” is more than country music — it’s Beyoncé music. —J.C.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clulg06yi006i3b81vzotx7qi@published data-word-count=9>➽ Read Craig Jenkins’s <a href=#>review of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cluloqn8u000m3b8afkf9a394@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Alesis,” Mk.gee</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clulorg3p00103b8a8j57f6na@published data-word-count=68>There’s a warm, slightly unmoored feeling to Mk.gee’s debut album, Two Star & The Dream Police, like it was made in a sensory-deprivation tank.

Even Maggie Rogers knows the feeling. On her sepia ballad “Don’t Forget Me,” she watches in shock as her friends’ relationships progress. “I’m still tryin’ to clean up my side of the street,” she sings. The title is a double plea: to the men who Rogers isn’t quite with for the long haul (“a good lover or a friend that’s nice to me”) and to her friends, progressing onto new stages of life. Rogers has made a name off emotional honesty, and she rarely sounds more unadorned than in the chorus, wailing over a swaying, ’70s-ish piano.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clulj5qor00873b811tnq0mx2@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Hiss,” Megan Thee Stallion</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clulj6jk8008g3b816xi4x5zz@published data-word-count=86>Oh, you do not want to get on Megan Thee Stallion’s bad side.

The song starts out claustrophobic, with Niko Kapetan’s voice hushed and quivering over an acoustic guitar. Then comes an electric riff, some pattering drums, more singers. It’s a formula executed to perfection — until it all crashes down in the bridge. The band’s passion is combustible; Kapetan said everyone was in tears by the end of the recording. That’s the power of a great rock crescendo. —J.C.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clvo53a4g004q3b8ev64liqlw@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Bye Bye,” Kim Gordon</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvo53six00523b8eneac66a8@published data-word-count=23>Is it Soundcloud rap?

Erika de Casier finds the most thrill in the small details of her crush, like the perfect way their white T-shirt fits. “I felt it in my body like whoa,” she sings, making that one syllable soar. The whole track flutters with ecstasy, especially the racing, clubby drum track, racing like a heartbeat.
