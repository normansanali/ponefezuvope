For whatever ingredient that is, the most successful rap groups all have one thing in common: their solid body work has cemented them as some of the best-selling musical groups of all time.

Consisted of longtime friends, they glued easily over music that they love and the reality they faced. Their most infamous hit, "F the Police," was, and still is, an anti-police brutality anthem all over the world. Until their split in 1991, the group has sold over 10 million units in the US alone despite the major backlash and radio ban.</p><h2 id=salt-n-pepa><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Salt-N-Pepa</span></h2><p>Members: Cheryl James, Sandra Denton</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the height of misogynistic views in rap music of the 1980s and the 1990s, Salt-N-Pepa broke the barrier and became one of the first all-female groups that actually took the scene by storm. Their contribution brought a fresh breath to the male-dominated genre, and they paved the way for future women artists to thrive, selling over 15 million units worldwide until their fall from grace in 2002.</p><h2 id=cypress-hill><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cypress Hill</span></h2><p>Members: B-Real, Sen Dog, Eric Bobo, DJ Muggs, Mellow Man</p><p>Cypress Hill is what happens when an elite DJ meets street wisdom: DJ Muggs and B-Real got real on the mic, and they were the anthem of every stoner back in the 1990s.
