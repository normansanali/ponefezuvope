Since season one of Bridgerton ended up being such a success amongst audiences, Season two quickly followed suit on Netflix’s streaming platform. Season one of the show gave viewers eight episodes breaking down the hot and cold romance between Daphne and Simon. They aren’t the only characters in the show viewers were totally enchanted by either! Here’s what you should know about the actors from season one and how their current net worths rank.</p><h3 id=rege-jean-page-plays-simon-bassett-and-has-a-net-worth-of-1-5-million data-injectable=false>Rege-Jean Page plays Simon Bassett and has a net worth of $1.5 million</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Regé-Jean Page (@regejean)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Rege-Jean Page starts the list off with a net worth of $1.5 million.

On Bridgerton, she plays Siena Rossa, and she currently has a net worth of $2.1 million. Filming intimate scenes on the show was quite enjoyable for Bartlett who described those moments as “liberating.“ According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>, she said, “It felt like this wonderful unbridled, shameless exploration of sex that we haven’t seen before, which I found so liberating.” Some actresses are hesitant to film intimate scenes for shows and movies, but Bartlett was obviously comfortable as ever to make these scenes come to life for the purpose of the show.</p><h3 id=luke-thomas-plays-benedict-bridgerton-and-has-a-net-worth-of-2-5-million data-injectable=false>Luke Thomas plays Benedict Bridgerton and has a net worth of $2.5 million</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Benedict Bridgerton (@benedict.bridgerton)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=737 data-current-count=1037 data-injectable=true>Luke Thomas has been acting for over eight years and has accumulated a net worth of $2.5 million today. Some of the major movies and TV shows he’s starred in aside from Bridgerton include Dunkirk, Making Noise Quietly, Misbehavior, In the Club, Hamlet, King Lear, and Kiss Me First. Thomas spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">F***ing Young</a> about his passion for acting in January 2022, saying, “I spent more time pretending to be fictional characters than being myself. My parents took me to amateur theatre groups where I started to perform in local productions. I was spotted in a show by an agent who sent me to my first audition. I booked that job and it soon became clear that it was specifically acting that I wanted to focus on moving forward.”</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>When the outlet asked him what he would do instead of acting, he responded by saying that he’d probably be a singer. He said, “I grew up listening to Elvis with my Nan. I spent a lot of time singing and still use my voice from time to time — I do so in the last episode of Bridgerton. Acting has always been my main passion but I’d love to combine the two and play a singer at some point.” It’s not surprising at all that he’s accumulated a net worth of $2.5 million based on how talented he is across-the-board. His stage presence is undeniable.</p><h3 id=ben-miller-plays-archibald-featherington-and-has-a-net-worth-of-5-million data-injectable=false>Ben Miller plays Archibald Featherington and has a net worth of $5 million</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ben Miller (@actualbenmiller)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=613 data-current-count=913 data-injectable=true>Archibald Featherington is played by Ben Miller, who currently has a net worth of $5 million.

He started acting back in 1986 and has been part of over 71 projects since then. It doesn’t seem that Miller will be slowing down anytime soon, with his net worth consistently growing as he continues to star in movies and TV shows. It’s ironic that the character who plays is in such debt, while he is actually doing quite well in the money department.</p><h3 id=phoebe-dynevor-plays-daphne-bridgerton-and-has-a-net-worth-of-11-million data-injectable=false>Phoebe Dynevor plays Daphne Bridgerton and has a net worth of $11 million</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by PD 🌗 (@phoebedynevor)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Phoebe Dynevor plays Daphne Bridgerton in the show and has the largest net worth of anyone else. She’s currently standing at $11 million. She started acting at the age of 14 and stuck with it to the point of landing the leading role in <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bridgerton</a></strong>. This Netflix show has certainly put her on the map and made her one of the most recognizable faces in television today.</p><p data-characters=705 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=false>When speaking about playing the role of Daphne, Dynevor told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">W Magazine,</a> “Being able to do a role where you learn a new skill is just such a dream. I recently played a potter and got to learn pottery. For Daphne, it’s terrible, because I really wanted to learn how to play piano, but then the pandemic happened, so I never got around to it. Which sounds silly, because you can easily learn from home. I had so much free time.” Even though Dynevor didn’t actually learn how to play piano to execute the role of Daphne, she brought out the acting skills to make it look believable enough in each episode of the show. It’s not surprising at all that she has such an impressive net worth these days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yjvsidnp6qpKS7br%2FEmqqopl2ku6Z5wpqqrWWilrusscNmmbJlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbridgerton-season-one-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbridgerton-season-one-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbridgerton-season-one-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbridgerton-season-one-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbridgerton-season-one-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbridgerton-season-one-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./caleb-hanie-net-worth-264680.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./caleb-hanie-net-worth-264680.html>Caleb Hanie Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bed-head-hair-wax-stick-review.html>Bed Head's Frizz-Taming Hair Wax Stick Is 44% Off at Amazon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bed-head-hair-wax-stick-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
