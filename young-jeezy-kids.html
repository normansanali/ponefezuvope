The court case’s fate is presently uncertain.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4070 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Daughter-Amra-Nor-Jenkins.jpg alt="Young Jeezy with his small daughter, Amara Nor Jenkins" width=520 height=504 sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4070 class=wp-caption-text>Young Jeezy with his small daughter, Amra Nor Jenkins</p><h2><strong>Jay Wayne is expecting a fourth child with his partner, Jeannie Mai</strong>.</h2><p>In the year 2021, Jeezy and Jeannie Mai married in their Atlanta house.
