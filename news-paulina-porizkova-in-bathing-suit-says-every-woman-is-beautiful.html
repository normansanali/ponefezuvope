The 57-year-old old shows off her famous figure in one of her latest Instagram posts, taken while on the beach. "Four years ago, I was on a vacation with friends in St Maarten. We were lounging on the beach, and I brought up the topic of superpowers. What were our real life superpowers? What did we think of our own and those of each other?" she captioned the post.&nbsp; How does she manage to look half her age and what is her superpower? Read on to find out and also learn about 6 ways Paulina Porizkova stays in shape both mentally and physically and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/GettyImages-1441028149.jpg><p><span>In her latest post, Paulina explains that she encourages women to love themselves by paying lots of compliments, which her friends call "her superpower." "</span><span>Everyone always thinks I get nothing but compliments all day long. So my friends and lovers, making the assumption I know and hear it all the time, very rarely give me one. I understand how it feels to be told by someone that you are beautiful to them. And the opposite. So I make a point of complimenting others," she said in the post. Is it shallow? Is it superficial? Maybe. But who cares when the result is a heartfelt smile and a little extra bounce in the step. Every woman is beautiful in her own and unique way. Why not celebrate it?" </span><span>She also refuses to listen to body shamers. "Body shaming is so last decade. Let's celebrate who we are, wrinkles and imperfections and all," she wrote in a recent Instagram caption after a troll tried to slam her for being too thin.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>While Paulina isn't a supporter of diet culture, she stays in shape by eating clean and healthy food – for the most part. "I live reasonably clean- don't much enjoy processed foods, but love a variety and do love my cakes," she wrote in a recent </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Instagram post</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/GettyImages-1394329833.jpg><p><span>Paulina enjoys exercise, but in moderation. "I started exercising when I was 40. I never did anything before that. Just cigarettes and poor nutrition. I could eat whatever I wanted because I smoked. Cindy [Crawford] would be there sweating and working out, and she had a fabulous body that she worked for and I was just like, 'Oh, that's stupid.' I had a good time being unhealthy for a while, but then you pay for it," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Elle</span></a><span>. These days she works out "at least three times a week- sometimes less, sometimes more," she revealed on Instagram. Her motivation to sweat is also different. I found out if I worked out every day my anxiety was kept a lot at bay. And I felt better. So how great is that?" she told Elle.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/GettyImages-1330803158.jpg><p><span>Paulina enjoys a social form of cardio. "I still dance. I've done boxing. I've done rowing. You name it, I've done it. Except for running. I don't like running. It doesn't feel good to me. It feels bad on my knees," she told Elle. "I'd rather do Zumba. And Bollywood dancing is a great way to get the aerobic part done. I do some really hard rowing classes. It's become something that's like brushing my teeth. It's something I have to do."</span></p><p><span>Paulina is also a big fan of pilates, revealing in a recent Instagram post that the Nofar Method, a New York City based studio, is her favorite. According to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>research,</span></a><span> Pilates exercises are designed to increase muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility, and to improve posture and balance. Experts maintain that it is a great workout for leaning out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;"I felt ashamed to be aging, and then on the other hand you go, 'But, I'm smarter, I'm better, I'm funnier, I'm more patient!' Overall as a person, I'm the best I've ever been. So I'm not ready to be dismissed," she explained to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>PEOPLE</span></a><span> about why she posts so much about aging. "You don't get to dismiss me because I have some wrinkles and sags and gray hair now, when I'm kind of fabulous, the most fabulous I've ever been. In fact, I'm going to just put it out there and go, you know what, this is me at my best. Deal with it!"</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkqZmlobavrYyppquhqqC8t62MoqVmmpGptaq6xmaqrqGkYsCixdJmnK%2Bdoq56uLvMmqVmoaNir6at1K2gn62cZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnews-paulina-porizkova-in-bathing-suit-says-every-woman-is-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnews-paulina-porizkova-in-bathing-suit-says-every-woman-is-beautiful.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnews-paulina-porizkova-in-bathing-suit-says-every-woman-is-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnews-paulina-porizkova-in-bathing-suit-says-every-woman-is-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnews-paulina-porizkova-in-bathing-suit-says-every-woman-is-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnews-paulina-porizkova-in-bathing-suit-says-every-woman-is-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./peacemaker-continues-trolling-the-justice-league-with-wonder-woman-and-flash-jokes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./peacemaker-continues-trolling-the-justice-league-with-wonder-woman-and-flash-jokes.html>Peacemaker continues trolling the Justice League with Wonder Woman and Flash jokes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./michael-michele.html>Michael Michele Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./michael-michele.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
