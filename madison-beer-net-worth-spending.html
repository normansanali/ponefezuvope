In reality, however, most of those people will never enjoy that kind of success because they don’t have the skills needed to stand out in the crowd. Amazingly enough, the same year Madison Beer turned 13-years-old, she caught the attention of one of the most successful singers in the world today, <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>. After all, once Beer began posting covers on YouTube, the megastar singer shared one of her videos on social media. Given the fact that he is such a massively popular star, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that <a href=#>Bieber's support helped Beer become a millionaire</a> for the first time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the years since Madison Beer first rose to fame and fortune, she has gone on to prove that she is far from a flash in the pan. In fact, Beer has managed to amass a highly impressive $16 million fortune even though she is only 22-years-old at the time of this writing. Of course, a lot of young adults aren’t exactly responsible with their money and they don’t have millions to fritter away. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, how does Madison Beer really spend her $16 million net worth?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About How Madison Beer Got Famous</a></span></p><h2 id=madison-rsquo-s-home>Madison’s Home</h2><p>In November of 2020, a report surfaced that <a href=#>Madison Beer had bought an impressive home in Encino</a>, Los Angeles, California. Described as a modern farmhouse, Beer’s home was built by real estate investors who clearly cashed in when Madison acquired the brand new living space. As a result of that purchase, Beer gets to enjoy her home’s pool, spa, guesthouse, and poolside cabana.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, when it comes to celebrity homes, people are typically most interested in the ways their living spaces stand out from the masses. Given the fact that Beer has so many overly passionate fans, it is a good thing that one of the main ways her home is unique is that it has a state-of-the-art security system. In a similar vein, Beer’s privacy is protected by the fact that her home is situated behind an impressive security gate, loads of privacy shrubbery, and several walls as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there are several other reasons why Madison Beer’s home is so impressive. For example, Beer’s home is located on the same street as houses owned by the likes of YouTubers Logan Paul, James Charles, and Rebecca Zamolo. More notably, Beer also lives on the same street as pop stars Selena Gomez, Gwen Stefani, and Kelly Clarkson, and pro athletes Tristan Thompson, Reggie Bush, and Mookie Betts. Considering all of the celebrities that she now lives near, it actually seems surprising that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beer only paid $5.6 million for her Encino living space</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Madison Beer Hates Being Compared To Ariana Grande</a></span></p><h2 id=riding-in-style>Riding In Style</h2><p>In the years since Justin Bieber first introduced many young people to Madison Beer when she was still a youngster, he has served as a mentor for her. Keeping that in mind, it makes sense that when it comes to how Beer spends her money, she has followed in Justin’s footsteps since Bieber owns several cars and so does Madison.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keeping in mind the fact that she doesn’t have nearly as many vehicles as some of her peers, including Justin Bieber, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison Beer still has a very impressive car collection</a>. After all, an awful lot of people Beer’s age are either driving around in their parent’s cars or a cheap vehicle that breaks down at every turn since they paid next to nothing for it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Justin Bieber Spends His $285 Million Net Worth</a></span>Right off the hop, it is simply amazing that Madison Beer owns a 2019 Ferrari 488 Spider. Of course, the vast majority of people could never fathom having the kind of money that is needed to purchase any Ferrari vehicle, let alone a 488 Spider. According to reports, Beer’s Ferrari would have set her back just over $280,000 which is a staggering number for any vehicle to cost.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to owning a Ferrari, Madison Beer also bought a pair of vehicles that are better equipped for driving around town. After all, according to reports, Beer has bought a black Range Rover Vogue and a Range Rover Sport. While those two vehicles are significantly more affordable than Beer’s Ferrari, that doesn’t mean they are cheap by any means. Sadly, Beer’s Range Rover Sport reportedly suffered a great deal of superficial damage after Madson’s then-boyfriends Jack Gilinski got into an accident while driving the vehicle. Of course, the important thing is that Gilinski walked away from the accident in good health but Beer had to be miffed to see her vehicle damaged like that.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Facts About Madison Beer That Will Surprise You</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmpyZqLyvecGenKtlnprBbsPOq6uhZaOlsq%2BwyKeeaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmadison-beer-net-worth-spending.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmadison-beer-net-worth-spending.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmadison-beer-net-worth-spending.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmadison-beer-net-worth-spending.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmadison-beer-net-worth-spending.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmadison-beer-net-worth-spending.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-def-leppards-rick-allen-returned-to-the-drums-with-just-one-arm.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-def-leppards-rick-allen-returned-to-the-drums-with-just-one-arm.html>How Def Leppard's Rick Allen Returned To The Drums With Just One Arm</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jersey-shore-best-and-worst-shore-store-employees-html.html>Danny Merk, Owner of The Shore Store, Reveals Who Was the Worst Worker</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jersey-shore-best-and-worst-shore-store-employees-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
