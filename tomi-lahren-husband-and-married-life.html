She is a contributor to Fox News as well.</strong></p><p>In addition, Tomi has garnered media attention for her divisive remarks, which include the now-famous The View interview in which the host underlined the importance of women having access to abortions legally.</p><p>Meanwhile, since splitting from her then-fiance Brandon Fricke, Lehren has also been a big topic in the dating scene. Midway in 2019, the former flames got engaged.</p><h2><span id=Tomi_Lahren_is_she_married_How_Did_Her_and_Brandon_Fricke8217s_Engagement_End>Tomi Lahren, is she married? How Did Her and Brandon Fricke’s Engagement End?</span></h2><p>Tomi hasn’t tied the knot yet and isn’t prepared to start a family. However, the well-known figure was previously engaged to iHeartMedia account executive Brandon Fricke. He was previously employed with Vanguard Sports Group as an assistant director of football operations.</p><p>In June 2019, Tomi revealed her engagement to Fricke, her former lover, while flaunting her sparkling pear-shaped ring. In the caption, she wrote:</p><p>“Those are my last thoughts and my declaration of my undying love for you. #loveyou #teamTomi #foreverandalways, 6/29/19</p><p>The assistant director also shared the exciting news at around the same time via an Instagram picture with the comment,</p><p>“Those are my last thoughts, and you are my forever. I love you more.”</p><p>For a few years, they had terrific chemistry together. However, it was short-lived, as the couple called off their engagement in April 2020. The Fox Nation host returned the $50,000 engagement ring to her soon-to-be husband Brandon, according to DailyMail.</p><p>The same tabloid reported in November 2019 that Brandon claimed a $50,000 debt in his congressional candidate financial report for an expensive ring he had purchased with his American Express card.</p><p>In an Instagram snapshot from early January 2020, Tomi was seen wearing the ring for the last time, together with her fiancé. Additionally, it was the final picture they posted on social media.</p><p>“It was the right choice, but it was a tough one for them both. Tomi expressed her feelings that she wasn’t ready to settle down. They still communicate frequently and encourage one another’s professional endeavors. There are no negative emotions and we sincerely hope to remain friends.</p><h2><span id=Brandon_Fricke_initially_messaged_his_fiancee_via_direct_message>Brandon Fricke initially messaged his fiancée via direct message.</span></h2><p>When Lahren and Glenn Beck were at odds, Fricke sent Lahren a supportive personal message in March 2019, which she later revealed on his Instagram. However, Lahren never replied to his mail from March 2017. Fricke eventually got to meet her after nine months.</p><p>He clarified,</p><p>Two years have passed since that DM, and she is now my actual #WCW. To be completely honest, I feel like a complete loser for ever having sent her that direct message because, after getting to know Tomi, I never doubted that she would always be true to herself and never back down from a position of authority. You inspire me every day with your courage and tenacity.”</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_the_Husband_of_Tomi_Lahren>Who Is the Husband of Tomi Lahren?</span></h2><p>Tomi and J.P. Arencibia are wed. On October 21, 2022, the couple said their vows in Nashville. For their wedding, they both donned identical white gowns. At their wedding, the bride and groom were stunningly lovely.</p><p>Tomi uploaded several pictures from her union to Instagram. It’s clear from the picture alone that the event was a lavish affair. There were lots of their family members and admirers present.</p><h2><span id=JP_Who_Is_Her_Husband>J.P., Who Is Her Husband?</span></h2><p>Her partner of choice is a Fox Sports Florida studio commentator. He used to be a professional baseball catcher with the Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays, among other clubs.</p><p>The couple started posting pictures of one other on their own social media accounts in February 2021, however they haven’t disclosed how they initially met.</p><p>The conservative pundit posted her first road trip photo with her new boyfriend on February 15. With a caption, she wrote,</p><p>A day later, Arencibia also uploaded a lovely photo from their sultry road trip, with the message, “It seems like their relationship is blossoming.”</p><p>“The future looks bright, but I love every day I get to spend with you.”</p><h2><span id=JP_Arencibia_the_boyfriend_of_Tomi_Lahren_was_Kimberly_Perry8217s_ex-husband>J.P. Arencibia, the boyfriend of Tomi Lahren, was Kimberly Perry’s ex-husband.</span></h2><p>Arencibia was formerly wed to lead singer of The Band Perry and country music performer Kimberly Perry. According to sources, the two first crossed paths in early 2012, and in October 2013, they were engaged at Perry’s parents’ home in Greenville, Tennessee, one year later.</p><p>They dated for a few months following their engagement before being hitched in June 2014. The Greenville home of Perry’s family served as the venue for their wedding celebration.</p><p>Unfortunately, their marriage didn’t last long, and in March 2018, they called it quits. Arencibia claimed that their long-term marriage was destroyed by infidelity.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_History_of_Tomi_Lahren_She_dated_a_Navy_SEAL_in_the_past>Relationship History of Tomi Lahren: She dated a Navy SEAL in the past</span></h2><p>Lahren was seeing her Navy SEAL boyfriend, Utah native Jerad Christian, back in 2015. The ex-couples got together for the first time in February 2015. Jerad was stationed at the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in San Diego at the time.</p><p>Additionally, Tomi was encouraged by her ex-lover to deliver an anti-Obama speech on One America News Network in 2015 that went viral and instantly catapulted her into the conservative spotlight. Lahren’s relationship with Christian likewise soured once she gained immediate notice from the media.</p><p>In addition, there were whispers that Tomi was seeing Jay Cutler, the ex-boyfriend of Kristin Cavallari, following her split from Brandon. In September 2020, the two were spotted enjoying dinner in Nashville, which ignited the initial speculations about their affair. However, they never replied to the rumors.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Charlie Bigelow, Shura Baryshnikov, and Tara Perry."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":26}{"1":28,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":45}{"1":51,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":61}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/charlie-bigelow/"}{"1":26}{"1":28,"2":"https://popularbio.com/shura-baryshnikov/"}{"1":45}{"1":51,"2":"https://popularbio.com/tara-perry/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Charlie Bigelow</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Shura Baryshnikov</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Tara Perry</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>media personality</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Justin Pugh Children | Does He Have Any Kid With Ange Pugh | Family Details</a></h3>Barry's career began in 1964 when he met CBS director Bro Herrod.
