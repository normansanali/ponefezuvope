On March 24, 2022, Netflix announced that the show Love Is Blind would return for a fourth and fifth season.</p><h2>Who Is Iyanna?</h2><p>Iyanna McNeely, age 27, had a wonderful word salad of a LinkedIn profile before appearing on the show. She had worked as a program coordinator for a surrogacy agency in Chicago. During the series, she developed a close friendship with Natalie, another pod dweller.</p><h2>Who is Jarrett?</h2><p>This season‚Äôs conclusion of Love Is Blind featured the wedding of Jarrette, a 32-year-old project manager, and Iyanna, a 27-year-old program coordinator, who had met and fallen in love in the Pods.</p><h2>Why Did Iyanna and Jarrett Divorce?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Iyanna-and-Jarrett.jpg><p>The duo announced their breakup less than a year after viewers witnessed them fall in love during the marriage experiment. Because Iyanna was Jarrette‚Äôs second pick for a wife, the couple had a rocky start.</p><p>Mallory Zapata was initially Jarrette‚Äôs top pick, but she ultimately said yes to Salvador Perez. Despite being initially hurt, Jarrette eventually asked Iyanna out, and she happily accepted. But when Jarrette and Mallory finally met in person on the group honeymoon vacation, sparks were evident between them.</p><p>It hurt their feelings when Iyanna and Salvador saw how attracted their partners were to one another. Nonetheless, they continued to get to know each other before making final decisions about getting married.</p><p>At the end of the season, Salvador decided against marrying Mallory since he recognized she wasn‚Äôt the one. The wedding between Iyanna and Jarrette went ahead as planned. Iyanna responded to one fan who noted how ‚Äúhappy‚Äù she and Jarrette looked together. ‚ÄúWe were üò≠ but our lives are moving in such different directions,‚Äù she shared.</p><p>But this week, Iyanna and Jarrette issued a joint statement announcing their separation after nearly a year of marriage. After releasing her report, Iyanna took to Twitter to address fans‚Äô questions and theories about the breakup. Iyanna told a fan who blamed Jarrette for the division, ‚ÄúWe tried our best.‚Äù A second supporter questioned the viability of the marriage experiment and the possibility of romantic attachment between persons who have never met in person. However, Iyanna insisted that ‚Äúdepending on the people,‚Äù the experiment was successful.</p><p>Iyanna laments that she and Jarrette wish their love ‚Äúwas enough for marriage but we realized the hard way that it isn‚Äôt.‚Äù Some of her followers on Twitter addressed the divorce rumors, and she retweeted them. Iyanna and Jarrette cited their ‚Äúdifferent directions‚Äù as the reason for their divorce.</p><p>Both participants in the televised marriage experiment expressed no remorse for their participation. People were rooting for Iyanna and Jarrette. In the series finale, they tied the knot together with another couple.<a href=# rel=noopener> Nick Thompson</a> and Danielle Ruhl are another happily married couple.</p><p>Many relationships ended throughout the second season of Love Is Blind. The tumultuous breakup between Shaina Hurley and Kyle Abrams was discussed in the episode. After she engaged to Kyle, Shaina started dating and married Christos Ladarkis.</p><p>Meanwhile, there have been speculations that Kyle is seeing <a href=# rel=noopener>Deepti Vempati</a>, who was once engaged to Abhishek ‚ÄúShake‚Äù Chatterjee but broke off the engagement after learning that he wasn‚Äôt genuinely interested in her. Another fan-favorite pair, Natalie Lee and Shayne Jansen broke up at the altar following a fight the night before the wedding. The first pair on the show to split up is Iyanna and Jarrette.</p><p>Keep following <a href=# rel=noopener>venturejolt.com</a> for more updates.
