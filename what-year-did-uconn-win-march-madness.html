The team has won four national championships, with the most recent coming in 2014.</span></p><p><span>UConn's first national championship came in 1999, when they defeated Duke in the championship game. The team was led by future NBA players Richard Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin, and they finished the season with a record of 34-2.</span></p><p><span>The Huskies returned to the Final Four in 2004, but they were knocked out in the semifinals by Georgia Tech. The team bounced back in 2011, when they won their second national championship. Led by Kemba Walker, UConn won five games in five days to capture the Big East Tournament championship, and then went on to win six more games in the NCAA tournament to capture the national championship.</span></p><p><span>In 2014, UConn won their fourth national championship, with a team led by Shabazz Napier, Ryan Boatright, and DeAndre Daniels. The team finished the season with a record of 32-8, and they defeated Kentucky in the championship game.</span></p><p><span>The 2014 championship was particularly impressive, as UConn was a No. 7 seed in the tournament. They defeated No. 10 seed Saint Joseph's in the first round, No. 2 seed Villanova in the second round, No. 3 seed Iowa State in the Sweet Sixteen, No. 4 seed Michigan State in the Elite Eight, No. 1 seed Florida in the Final Four, and then No. 8 seed Kentucky in the championship game.</span></p><p><span>The championship was the fourth for head coach Kevin Ollie, who had taken over the program in 2012 after the retirement of longtime coach Jim Calhoun. Ollie had played for Calhoun at UConn in the 1990s, and he was able to continue the winning tradition of the program.</span></p><p><span>UConn's success in the NCAA tournament has made them one of the most successful programs in college basketball. The team has made 32 appearances in the tournament, and they have reached the Final Four eight times. In addition to their four national championships, they have also won seven Big East Conference championships and five American Athletic Conference championships.</span></p><p><span>While UConn has had tremendous success in the NCAA tournament, they have also faced their fair share of challenges over the years. The program was placed on probation by the NCAA in the 1990s, and they were forced to forfeit several wins and were banned from postseason play for a year. However, the program was able to bounce back from these setbacks and continue to build on their success.</span></p><p><span>Overall, UConn's success in the NCAA tournament has made them one of the most storied programs in college basketball. Their four national championships and numerous Final Four appearances are a testament to the quality of the program and the dedication of the coaches and players who have been a part of it.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXa6yor6MnaCdZaWYvK%2B6jLCgp2Wdlr%2BktIymmJ2mlajA</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-year-did-uconn-win-march-madness.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-year-did-uconn-win-march-madness.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-year-did-uconn-win-march-madness.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-year-did-uconn-win-march-madness.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-year-did-uconn-win-march-madness.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-year-did-uconn-win-march-madness.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./where-will-the-2028-olympics-be-held-in-los-angeles.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./where-will-the-2028-olympics-be-held-in-los-angeles.html>Where will the 2028 Olympics be held in Los Angeles?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-detective-cassady.html>What happened to detective Cassady?
