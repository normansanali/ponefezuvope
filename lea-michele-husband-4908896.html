It also included a photo of the two of them, which can be seen above, standing and looking out at the water as she had her hand around him. “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">Last year, in this same spot, on this same day, you told me 30 was going to be the best year of my life.. it was. So much to be grateful for, but mostly you.. got a feeling 31 is going to be even better… ❤️ u Z,” her caption read.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>By summer 2017, it was confirmed they were definitely in a relationship and they went on to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>get engaged</a> in Apr. 2018. “I think the first thing I said to him was, ‘Stop joking around!’ So I was super surprised,” Lea told <a class="body-link css-gegin5 et3p2gv0" href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/lea-michele-zandy-reich-are-married/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told People" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a> about the moment Zandy proposed to her. “Everyone said, ‘Try to be present because it’ll happen so quickly.’ Which I didn’t listen to at all and blacked out and I barely remember.

Is this happening?'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The couple got hitched in March 2019 and Lea has regularly showed off <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>epic photos</a> from the special day in various posts on social media, especially on their anniversaries.</p><h2>Zandy has his own successful career.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Zandy, who grew up in Philadelphia and attended the University of Philadelphia, co-founded the clothing company, AYR, which stands for “All Year Round,” in 2016.

That friendship remained until they turned it into a romance around 2016. Zandy also appeared with the couple they met through and others, in a photo Lea shared in July 2016, which was right around the time it’s believed they started dating. The group was sitting back on lounge chairs outside and smiling for the camera.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">“Family photo at the Lowe’s 🍋 #PerfectSunday&nbsp;#ThisIsTheLife,” she captioned the snapshot, which can be seen above.</span></p><h2>Do Lea and Zandy have any children?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lea-Michele-Husband-Zandy-Reich-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>The lovebirds welcomed their son, <strong>Ever Leo</strong>, in Aug. 2020. The doting mom often shares <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sweet photos</a> with her little boy on social media, but always keeps his face covered to keep him protected from the public. She did <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>show a bit more</a> of what he looked like when he was a baby, in a cute photo of Zandy holding him as he wore sunglasses, when she posted a birthday tribute to her husband in Jan. 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“Greatest man, father, husband and friend,” the actress wrote in the love-filled post. “I wake up every day so thankful that you are ours Z.
