<time>05 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>St Kitts likes to party. Why? Because its islanders love to go out, visitors are eager to make the most of their often short holiday time here, and the presence of many overseas students adds a youthful energy to its plentiful beach bars and nightspots. Most of these are in the centre of the island, and it's easy to move around by taxi – Friday is the liveliest time for after-dark fun, while on Sunday, everything happens on the beach in the afternoon. Many venues have DJs, but for live music, it's best to ask your concierge or look out for flyers.</p><h3>South Frigate Bay</h3><h4>Mr X's Shiggidy Shack</h4><p>This is one of the best known beach bars on 'The Strip' of watering holes and nightspots that borders South Frigate Bay Beach. A simple, sand-under-your-toes, wood-and-palm leaf shack, Mr X's has a friendly and inclusive atmosphere and soon fills up if there's a cruise ship visiting. During the day, it's an easygoing place to grab some beach time, with watersports and boat trips available and a menu featuring burgers, ribs and fish dishes. Thursday nights are the time to go if you want to party, when there is a bonfire and live band. What to drink? A Shiggidy Jig rum punch, of course.</p><p><b>Contact: </b>00 1 869 663 4578; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>Facebook page</a><br><b>Prices: </b>£<br><b>Getting in:</b> Just turn up</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Mr X's has a friendly and inclusive atmosphere and soon fills up if there's a cruise ship visiting</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best things to do in St Kitts</a></p><h4>Vibes Beach Bar & Grill</h4><p>Vibes is a large, slick, open-sided venue at the heart of 'The Strip', with televisions screening major sports events and a DJ booth that likes to play the latest international hits at max. Close by is a colourfully painted tower similar to a lifeguard station with a bar described as 'topless' (roofless). Staff wear company T-shirts and you can fill up on burgers, salads and pasta dishes. Carib and Stag beers are good value, and look out for promotions for its themed parties featuring a sea of foam or fireworks.</p><p><b>Contact:</b> 00 1 869 465 8423; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>vibesbeachbar.com</a><br><b>Prices:</b> £<br><b>Getting in:</b> Just turn up</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Fill up on burgers, salads and pasta dishes at Vibes, as you relax by the beach</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best beaches in St Kitts</a></p><h4>The Dock</h4><p>The Dock is part of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy Beach Resort</a> –a metal-roofed wooden building set at the eastern end of South Frigate Bay Beach – and close to a jetty and a small sandy beach. In the afternoon, it's an easygoing hangout, then in the evening it becomes one of the pit-stops along 'The Strip', with bright rope lights adding a party mood. It is popular with both locals and visitors with Sunday the main night when there's a live band playing reggae or soca (usually 9pm-midnight). During Happy Hour (Mon-Fri, 5pm-6pm, Sun, 3pm-4pm) local beers are half-price. Snacks including pizza, burgers and wings are available.</p><p><b>Contact:</b> 00 1 869 465 8597; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>timothybeach.com</a><br><b>Prices:</b> £<br><b>Getting in:</b> Just turn up</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Dock is popular with both locals and visitors for its live reggae or soca performances</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best restaurants in St Kitts</a></p><h3>North Frigate Bay</h3><h4>Uncle Fat's</h4><p>With 30 television screens showing sports and youth-orientated entertainment, this large industrial bar and microbrewery is a hit with locals and visitors looking for a lively place to enjoy themselves. Its Jolly Roger beers slip down easily and include an 'Eye Patch' IPA and a 'Walk the Plank' lager. Menus are on tablets and dishes include a crispy seafood platter, jerk chicken and mac and cheese. On some nights, there is a DJ or live band and as many as 300 people having fun, with Saturday particularly busy.</p><p><b>Contact:</b> 00 1 869 466 7999; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>unclefats.com</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££<br><b>Getting in: </b>Just turn up</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Uncle Fat's</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best hotels in St Kitts</a></p><h4>Buddah Bar</h4><p>Had enough sunshine and beach? Enter this small, air-conditioned bar on Zenway Boulevard, with large television screens and flashing neon lights and you'll be in a very different world. Specialising in 'deep house and sushi', its shiny silver walls and white armchairs are a suitably cool backdrop for a mixed crowd tucking into Thai curries and unconventional drinks like the <i>coronarita</i> (a margarita with Corona beer). When you've had some fun but don't yet want to go home, the Buddah Bar is waiting. Weekends are busiest.</p><p><b>Contact:</b> 00 1 869 767 6000; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>Facebook page</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££<br><b>Getting in:</b> Just turn up</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>You can tuck into Thai curries and unconventional drinks at Buddah Bar</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best free things to do at St Kitts</a></p><h3>Old Road Bay</h3><h4>Sprat Net Bar & Grill</h4><p>Wedged between the sea and the island's coastal road, Sprat Net is a large, casual wooden barn of a place owned by two fishermen. There's a garden area by the waterfront while the odd cannon and nautical paraphernalia add a touch of theming. Popular with both locals and visitors, but refreshingly away from the tourist zones, it serves fresh fish, lobster and seafood without fuss in informal surroundings – get your order in early, portions are large. There is good live music on Wednesdays (usually reggae) and Fridays (usually soca), starting around 8pm.</p><p><b>Contact:</b> 00 1 869 661 1901; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>Facebook page</a><br><b>Prices:</b> £<br><b>Getting in: </b>Just turn up</p><h3>South Friars Bay</h3><h4>Carambola Beach Club</h4><p>At the western end of South Friars Bay Beach, Carambola Beach Club brings a touch of Ibiza to the St Kitts' beach bar scene. Smart daybeds and wooden loungers with lime green parasols are set on grey-yellow sands, with a large modern bar and restaurant serving modern European dishes with a Caribbean twist. Carambola is popular with cruise ship visitors and often used for private functions. The menu is a comforting international mix including butternut squash ravioli, grilled lobster tail and pineapple tarte tatin. Or just drop in for a cocktail and some sushi.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Contact:</b> 00 1 869 465 9090; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>carambolabeachclub.com</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££<br><b>Getting in: </b>Restaurant reservations recommended&nbsp;</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Expect smart daybeds with lime green parasols and grey-yellow sands at Carambola Beach Club</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Picasa</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best restaurants in Nevis</a></p><h4>ShipWreck Beach Bar & Grill</h4><p>At the east end of South Friars Bay Beach, ShipWreck is a friendly beach bar and grill that is popular with visitors, resident expats and overseas students with their dogs. It is set on the rocks above a narrow strip of sand, so it catches the breeze and has fine views over the sometimes choppy waters below. The look is decidedly scruffy castaway with ramshackle wooden decking, fishing nets hanging from the rafters and a blizzard of marker-pen graffiti testifying to the many good times had here. Facilities include a watersports outlet and a shop selling beachwear, plus a menu offering local fish, salads, burgers, chicken and ribs. On Sunday there's often live music around 4pm-6.30pm, usually reggae or soca. There is no Wi-Fi.</p><p><b>Contact: </b>00 1 869 764 7200; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>shipwreckstkitts.com</a><br><b>Prices: </b>£<br><b>Getting in:</b> Just turn up</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>ShipWreck, set on the rocks above a narrow strip of sand, catches the breeze and has fine views</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best things to do in Nevis</a></p><h3>Whitehouse Bay</h3><h4>Salt Plage</h4><p>Salt Plage is part of the developing Christophe Harbour real estate project and close to a new superyacht marina. It sits beside the clear waters of Whitehouse Bay, well-placed for the sunset, and has palm trees, a wooden jetty, contemporary outdoor lounge seating and a maritime theming mixed with rusty metal sheeting to evoke the bygone days of the sugar and salt trades. There is free Wi-Fi and the drinks include wine, champagne and cocktails. Snacks such as mahi mahi ceviche and a veggie burger are available. In high season, there is usually themed entertainment such as a 'reggae lobster' night on Thursday and a Cuban band on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Contact: </b>00 1 869 465 8304; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>christopheharbour.com</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££<br><b>Getting in:</b> Reservations recommended</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Salt Plage is well-placed for watching the sunset</span></figure><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The best nightlife in Nevis</a></p><h3>Cockleshell Bay</h3><h4>Reggae Beach Bar and Grill</h4><p>'Rush Slowly' is the motto of this well-known wooden beach bar and grill at the south-eastern tip of the island. With safe, shallow waters, it's one of the best places to have some seaside fun, although a pier used for fast boat transfers to Nevis means there is always a lot of coming and going. The soundtrack is predominantly reggae and the menu offers salads, sandwiches and grilled fish, with a Lobster Fest on Friday nights including a live band. Beach loungers and umbrellas can be rented and adjacent outlets offer watersports and massages. Wi-Fi is free and there is a large gift shop. Reggae Beach Bar is popular with cruise passengers, so if you prefer things quiet go on a day where there isn't a ship in port.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Contact: </b>00 1 869 762 5050; <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>reggaebeachbar-grill.com</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££<br><b>Getting in:</b> Reservations recommended for Lobster Fest</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>With safe, shallow waters, Reggae is one of the best places to have some seaside fun</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6dnKysmaOutbXOp6pom5GntqOuxJqlaKuRnru1ecqiq62rXZa7pXnNnq2iq1%2BWv7W1wqWcrGejqXqstdOtqmammZy1tbjIn5xo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsaint-kitts-and-nevis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsaint-kitts-and-nevis.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsaint-kitts-and-nevis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsaint-kitts-and-nevis.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsaint-kitts-and-nevis.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsaint-kitts-and-nevis.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ving-rhames.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ving-rhames.html>Ving Rhames Fan Casting</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./teyana-taylor-net-worth-2023-wiki-bio-age-husband-family-house.html>Teyana Taylor Net Worth 2023: Wiki, Bio, Age, Husband, Family &amp;amp; House</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./teyana-taylor-net-worth-2023-wiki-bio-age-husband-family-house.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
