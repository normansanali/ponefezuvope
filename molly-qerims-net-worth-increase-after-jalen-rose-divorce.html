<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>In December of 2021, one of the most publicized couples in sports journalism announced their separation. According to court records in Hartford County, Connecticut, ESPN's Jalen Rose has filed for divorce from "First Take" moderator Molly Qerim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rose, a veteran of 16 years in the league, now works as an analyst for the network's NBA pregame show "NBA Countdown." In college, Rose was a part of Michigan's legendary "Fab Five" team that twice advanced to the national championship game.</p><p>According to many sources, the divorce was peaceful, and the parties continue to get along well, which begs the question: did the divorce settlement give Qerim a financial boost?</p><h2 id=molly-qerim-rsquo-s-impressive-net-worth-in-2023>Molly Qerim’s Impressive Net Worth In 2023</h2><p>Journalist Molly Qerim got her start at WFSB-TV in Hartford, Connecticut, before moving on to become an anchor at ESPN. She also presided over the television shows NFL Live and First Take.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/stephen-a-smith-molly-qerim-and-skip-bayless.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After its 2003 debut, First Take immediately attracted a sizable audience. Millions of people watched it every day, making it one of ESPN's most-watched programs. In 2015, Qerim became the show's moderator and host.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>WWE To Become Monopolized by ESPN?</a></span></p><p>Her charisma, grace, and ability to keep discussions calm while still allowing for intense arguments make her the ideal choice to moderate the show.</p><p>As of the year 2023, Qerim has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amassed a net worth of $4 million</a>. All of her earnings, including her salary from ESPN, sponsorship deals, and guest appearances, add up to this total. Qerim relies heavily on her annual compensation from ESPN, which is reported to be approximately $1 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/molly-querim-on-set.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Qerim's career in journalism has come a long way, and she's just becoming better as time goes on. She is a role model for young journalists because of her perseverance and dedication.</p><p>The details of her financial situation, beyond these tidbits, remain unknown. Despite the absence of details, it is likely that she earns a comfortable living thanks to her now-established career.</p><h2 id=why-did-molly-qerim-and-jalen-rose-get-divorced>Why Did Molly Qerim And Jalen Rose Get Divorced?</h2><p>Jalen Rose and Molly Qerim are two well-known faces you may recognize from ESPN. While they are normally in the headlines for their opinions on sports, the fact that they recently divorced has garnered a lot of attention from the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4-2.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the divorce was amicable, the reasons for it are yet unknown. It has been theorized that Molly Qerim's friendship with Stephen A. Smith, a coworker, was the cause of Jalen Rose and Qerim's breakup. The rumor has caused speculations that <a href=#>the NBA players are beefing</a> over Qerim’s attention.</p><p>Jalen Rose sets the record straight in his interview with GQ's Tyler R. Tynes, shutting down rumors that his split with Molly Qerim was due to her alleged relationship with Stephen A. Smith. Though <a href=#>Smith has angered a lot of people</a>, Rose certainly isn’t one of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>ESPN Analyst And Former NFL Quarterback Ryan Leaf Arrested</a></span></p><p>Rose confidently stated that he knew the rumors weren't true. He chose not to respond to them, as he believed it would only make those who spread them appear less credible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s not true. But, when it happened, it’s two ways for me to handle it as a professional: I work with him, I got love for him, and that's my brother. I got love for her, we were friends before we were married, we just didn’t work as a couple. I just saw her today. We cool! But for me to see the speculation and for people to assume that was why, it bothered me.”</p><p>Why the rumors "bothered" Jalen Rose is reasonable. It's completely understandable to feel uneasy about false information being spread, especially when it comes to such a sensitive topic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2-7.png><p>According to court documents, Rose stated that their marriage had irretrievably broken down after Qerim relocated to Connecticut. According to TMZ, Rose expressed that he and Qerim have decided that staying friends and colleagues is the best way to move forward with their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Qerim cried in June 2021, just two months after Rose filed for divorce, as she talked about his difficulties and the deaths of several members of his family.</p><p>With tears streaming down her face, she lovingly referred to him as her 'husband' while sharing the heartbreaking news of losing five family members this year. As she spoke out about him, Molly referred to it as "a hard couple of years."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3-6.png><p>Rose is taking a stand in his divorce documents by refusing to ask for alimony and making it clear that he doesn't want Qerim to receive it either, according to the outlet. Qerim is not seeking spousal support, and there's no prenup in place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe the rumors about his divorce will finally die down now that Rose has cleared the air. The public nature of famous people's social lives frequently provides fertile ground for gossip. Now that the truth about Qerim and Stephen A. Smith has been exposed, she can perhaps <a href=#>move on from the divorce in good faith</a>.</p><h2 id=did-molly-qerim-rsquo-s-net-worth-increase-since-divorcing-jalen-rose>Did Molly Qerim’s Net Worth Increase Since Divorcing Jalen Rose?</h2><p>According to Hollywoodworth, Molly Qerim's net worth of $3 million in 2021, when she divorced Jalen Rose, stayed the same in 2022, suggesting that her wealth may not have changed significantly following the announcement of her divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TT--(40).png><p>In 2023, however, her wealth has increased from $3 million to $4 million, suggesting that she may have received some form of compensation as a result of the controversy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rose, an NBA star, has seen his net worth rise since splitting from his wife. ClutchPoints estimated that Jalen Rose had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $50 million in 2021</a>. By the year 2023, this figure will have increased to $52 million.</p><p>If Rose suddenly finds herself awash in riches, it's unlikely to affect Qerim's financial situation because her annual salary of $3 to $4 million is about equal to his whole net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>ESPN’s All-Time Basketball Player Rank Creates Chaos</a></span></p><p>Since divorcing Rose, it appears that Qerim's wealth has increased, however, this is likely a two-way street.</p><p>It seems like there won't be a dramatic battle over money, even though there was no prenuptial agreement in place. Since they didn't have any children together, there won't be any child support concerns to deal with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's difficult to maintain a long-distance marriage in this line of work.
