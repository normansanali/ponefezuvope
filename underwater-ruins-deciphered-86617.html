I sat with it for hours and tried to break it, thank arceus I didn't sit any longer..<br>Anyways.<p>I have several theories, the first one is that Kyurem is the "King".<br>Something looks obviously wrong with it, it doesn't have the typical generator tail like its siblings and like someone said before, it looks sick/deformed/old/ripped apart.<br>The question is why?<br>Well, it could be...<br>a) A meteorite was falling down at Isshu but Kyurem knocked it off a bit so it fell down in the outskirts (Giant chasm) and therefore it saved evryone from waves (tsunamis or pure power waves from the hit), though Kyurem got seriously injured of it.<br>b) The abyssal ruins is made <i>by pokémon</i>, when 'Zekram' splitted into two and fighted with eachother numberous disasters followed, like fires, waves and you name it, Kyurem might have saved the pokémon from waves and got help from the musketeers (whom distrust humans in their legend due to humans misbehaves/wars).<br>c) In this theory Kyurem could be the 'harmony form' (aka 'zekram'), being both reshiram and zekrom. Reshiram is the pokémon of truth whilst Zekrom is for ideals if you remember...</p><p>"Reshiram, who will awake from the Light Stone, and the already-awakened Zekrom were originally one Pokémon. ...That one dragon Pokémon made a new land together with twin heroes. And people and Pokémon lived their days happily!</p><p>But one day... The older of the two heroes sought the truth, and the younger sought the ideal. A dividing struggle began to decide who was right... The single dragon that had walked with the twins was also split into two to support both...</p><p>A dark dragon that searched through the new, hopeful world for its ideal... Its name was Zekrom.<br>And another... A light dragon that searched through the world of the past for the truth... Its name was Reshiram." &lt;-Pokémon Black</p><p>In the abyssal ruins, 'King' possesses both ideals (dreams, adventure etc) and truth (primes..? o_o).<br>Reshiram <i>is</i> a prime number pokémon in <i>both</i> Isshu and National pokédex(No 149 and 641). (Kyurem is not)</p><p>Also, about those corners, just look at the first floor map of Abyssal ruins, seriously? those "corners" are when the way split in two, then at the 2,3,5 and 7 'way split' you turn in relation to what direction you just were walking in, and you will end up in about the center of the labyrinth (way up to next floor) regardless of what enterance you go from.</p><p>About Zekrom and ideals I'm not sure, but I guess "King" showed evryone his ideals by saving evryone from the waves..</p><p>About the tales from the town near Giant chasm, who says Kyurem EATS people!? In their tale say it's a monster in a hole up north(obviously kyurem) and people/pokémon disappear, but I can't imagine Kyurem eating pokémon nor people. The old grandma says no one beleives in <i>stories</i> nowadays, which is a lot different than that they don't beleive in the story, especially since evryone is sure to be indoors at night.</p><p>About waves, water and all, The bridge village overflooded, well let's say atleast 2~300 years ago, maybe Kyurem saw the meteorite long before it should have landed, and it took like 2700 years to stop it, and the people at that time dedicated a temple to its honor!?...okay maybe not.</p><p>I've also considered that maybe you will time travel in Grey? How cool wouldn't it be, seeing relic castle, abyssal ruins and dragonspiral tower in their former states?<br>I beleive Black version is 'the real story' even though I got white.<br>Reshiram fits perfectly into the warm, fire-dedicated relic castle in the present desert along with the übercute volcarona.<br>Zekrom totally fits into the damp climate up north at dragonspiral tower...<br>..and then Kyurem at Abyssal Ruins!</p><p>Anyways, I'll go more on-topic again since I gradually went off.. Hihi this is so fun Cx<br>My first thought of Abyssal ruins were "WATER LEGEND POKÉMON!?" but then I reminded myself that Keldeo is the only one, and not being a big enough of a character to get a labyrinth temple.</p><p>Oh by the way, I find it a funny coincidence that Abyssal ruins is a labyrinth going towards the center and UP, likewise Giant chasm and Kyurem.<br>Maybe Kyurem will have another form that is Dragon/Water? Not likely, but still.. water.. I just wanted to say it. I have a lot to say u_u</p><p>ONE LAST THING OKAY!?<br>Someone talked about the different energies, fire, electrical being two of them whilst cold definitly not is one.<br>Then, there actually IS a sentence saying<br>"King's light shines."<br>Light energy. Wait, LIGHT!? The toxicated Light type discussion- yes, what if Kyurem actually is Light/dragon? No, Probably not... I asume that sentence is about 'Zekram' that would be both fire/electric in some weird way and both of the two spread a nice light... but kyurem has yellow markings! what <i>if</i>?</p><p>Aaaand sorry for my behaviour of striking things, I just think this thing is so exciting.<br>EDIT: This turned into an essay o_o'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy2usOeqbCZpJq%2Fbr7UoqWsZZSasKq8x56pnpxebYN3fZZop5qflWKB</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2funderwater-ruins-deciphered-86617.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2funderwater-ruins-deciphered-86617.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2funderwater-ruins-deciphered-86617.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2funderwater-ruins-deciphered-86617.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2funderwater-ruins-deciphered-86617.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2funderwater-ruins-deciphered-86617.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-homm9k-on-tiktok-age-real-name-and-instagram-bio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-homm9k-on-tiktok-age-real-name-and-instagram-bio.html>Who is Homm9k On TikTok?
