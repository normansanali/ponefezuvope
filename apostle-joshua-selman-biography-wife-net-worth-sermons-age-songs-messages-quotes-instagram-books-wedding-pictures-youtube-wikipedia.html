He is a called minister of God and spiritual father to so many souls globally.</p><p>He heads, founded, and plays the senior pastor role in the renowned <strong>Nigerian Eternity Network International</strong> church (ENI). We can trace his ministerial journey back to his campus days.</p><p><strong>Apostle Joshua Selman</strong>‘s messages, preaching, and we can find his sermons videos on various media spaces, including WhatsApp statuses, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok and more.</p><table class="infobox person"><tbody><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Apostle Joshua Selman: History • Bio • Photo</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Real Name:</td><td>Joshua Selman Nimmak</td></tr><tr><td>Stage Name:</td><td>Apostle Joshua Selman</td></tr><tr><td>Born:</td><td>25 June 1980 (age 41 years old)</td></tr><tr><td>Place of Birth:</td><td>Jos, Plateau, Nigeria</td></tr><tr><td>State Of Origin:</td><td>Plateau State</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality:</td><td>Nigerian</td></tr><tr><td>Height:</td><td>1.72 m</td></tr><tr><td>Parents:</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings:</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Wife • Spouse:</td><td>Sandra Areh Chinelo</td></tr><tr><td>Girlfriend • Partner:</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Children:</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation:</td><td>Clergyman • Chemical Engineer</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth:</td><td>US$4 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-education></span>Early Life & Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Apostle <strong>Joshua Selman</strong> was born on the 25th of June, 1980, in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria, but grew up and had his education in Zaria, Kaduna State. Aged&nbsp;41 years, his state of origin is Plateau State where he was born.</p><p>Apostle&nbsp;<strong>Joshua Selman</strong>‘s family, siblings, father and mother hasn’t been discussed on the media spaces.</p><p>The supernatural manifestation of God’s power in his life confirms that he was called to serve God at a young age. During a Sunday School class, he was reborn as a child.</p><p>God provided Apostle&nbsp;<strong>Joshua Selman</strong> with a mentor throughout his secondary school years who assisted him in developing a quiet-time schedule and taught him the fundamentals of Christian character. As a result of his genuine love for God, he was given the required drive. He then began to seek God with all his heart and soul.</p><p>His persistent devotion to God, even as a teenager, drew a lot of attention since he had an interest in spiritual matters. While his companions were playing, the Apostle was constantly seen reading and studying the scriptures carefully.</p><p>This assisted in Apostle&nbsp;<strong>Joshua Selman</strong>‘s preparation and moulding for the work ahead. Shortly after, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit by a man of God who had been invited and thus started his ‘adventure’ into the supernatural world. By applying their faith, he and four other friends perform miracles in the class. Some of the things he stepped into were labelled heresies along the way.</p><p>This caused him and his pals to fall out of favour, but things changed on December 2, 2002, when someone tapped him on the hand while he was sleeping; when he awoke, he knew it was Jesus, but he couldn’t explain how he knew. His contact with Christ was his first. He started crying as he rededicated himself to the Master’s service.</p><p>According to the record, Apostle&nbsp;<strong>Joshua Selman</strong> had a dream in which he was serving in a university and began interacting with heavenly characters and prominent apostles of God. As a result, it is only fair to say that the youngster had a sense of what was in store for him even before entering the institution.</p><p>There is no record of his primary and secondary school studies. Still, Apostle&nbsp;<strong>Joshua Selman</strong> graduated as a chemical engineer at <strong>Ahmadu Bello University</strong> in Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria, where he started his ministry with the help of his friends.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Let’s give a breakdown and detail of how&nbsp;<strong>Apostle Joshua Selman</strong>‘s ministry began.</p><p><strong>Apostle Joshua Selman</strong>&nbsp;started while he was in school. He frequently prays to ask God to show him the purpose of his life. He had a vision one night in which he was standing in front of a tower that looked like one of the University dorms when he suddenly saw an endless sea of people.</p><p>They were all wailing and crying because they didn’t have food or drink, but he was moved with sympathy. He appeared to have the key to their answers in the vision, and they confirmed that he was the reason they were where they were. He then woke up after telling them he was coming to fix it straight immediately.</p><p>This was when Apostle&nbsp;<strong>Joshua Selman</strong> realized God had called him to be a clergyman and preacher. His most memorable encounter was when <strong>Jesus Christ </strong>appeared and stood before him. All <strong>Jesus </strong>did was extend out His hand towards him, and a bright light shone down on him.</p><p>That event ushered in a new level of anointing and knowledge in his life, as he began to gain unprecedented insight into the Bible.</p><p><strong>Apostle Joshua Selman</strong> and his pals made the most of the opportunity to share the love of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> with their classmates. They stuck to their guns and preached at every program they were allowed to.</p><p>In March 2011, he lost no time in establishing <strong>Eternity Network International</strong> in Zaria, Kaduna State, in light of his revelation of the great anointing upon him and following the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=about-koinonia></span>About KOINONIA<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the same year, 2011 and at the same location, the ministry held a KOINONIA program.</p><p><strong>Koinonia</strong> is a Greek phrase that properly means “Christian friendship or communion, with God or, more usually, with other Christians.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Apostle&nbsp;<strong>Joshua Selman</strong> is married to <strong>Lady Sandra Areh Chinelo</strong>, who is also known as Selwoman after the Apostle’s surname “Selman.” He has spent most of his youth fulfilling God’s call on his life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The real net worth of this man of God Apostle&nbsp;<strong>Joshua Selman</strong> can be difficult to quantify since, aside from assets and ministry profits, there may be other secret persons who have been blessed by the man of God’s sermons and have ended up donating his wealth.</p><p>According to an internet source, Apostle <strong>Joshua Selman</strong>‘s net worth is believed to be US$4 million. He has a well-established ministry and is one of Nigeria’s most powerful and rich preachers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1flr2wv9OlnGain6i1tq2MrJylpZGjeqO1zqCpmqiYrnq4tcWeZKedpGLEsL7ToWSsnaKivK%2B%2FjJqenmWjpLuov4ymnKyrkZyytHnQrqatnaNitq%2B%2F05qeq5mdYq%2Bwu8qsZLCdlJm2r7OMqaCcrKWnsrR52Kisra2Smnq4tcqip56cmZZ8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fapostle-joshua-selman-biography-wife-net-worth-sermons-age-songs-messages-quotes-instagram-books-wedding-pictures-youtube-wikipedia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fapostle-joshua-selman-biography-wife-net-worth-sermons-age-songs-messages-quotes-instagram-books-wedding-pictures-youtube-wikipedia.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fapostle-joshua-selman-biography-wife-net-worth-sermons-age-songs-messages-quotes-instagram-books-wedding-pictures-youtube-wikipedia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fapostle-joshua-selman-biography-wife-net-worth-sermons-age-songs-messages-quotes-instagram-books-wedding-pictures-youtube-wikipedia.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fapostle-joshua-selman-biography-wife-net-worth-sermons-age-songs-messages-quotes-instagram-books-wedding-pictures-youtube-wikipedia.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fapostle-joshua-selman-biography-wife-net-worth-sermons-age-songs-messages-quotes-instagram-books-wedding-pictures-youtube-wikipedia.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./backstage-reaction-to-darby-allin-referencing-cody-rhodes-on-2-14-aew-dynamite-promo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./backstage-reaction-to-darby-allin-referencing-cody-rhodes-on-2-14-aew-dynamite-promo.html>Backstage Reaction to Darby Allin Referencing Cody Rhodes on 2/14 AEW Dynamite Promo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ani-lupe.html>Ani Lupe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ani-lupe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
