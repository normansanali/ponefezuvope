If it’s the former (as it has to be, at least to some extent), they fall in line with the curious character Doug Randle.

Panda Bear, <i>Person Pitch</i> (Paw Tracks, 2007)</b><br>The comparatively warm and cuddly one in Animal Collective makes a surprise appearance as a Daft Punk mouthpiece in “Doin’ It Right,” a heartening and decidedly human ode near the new album’s end.

(Tip to aspiring hit-makers: it never hurts to have your song coupled with the image of Ryan Gosling looking stoic and cool.)
