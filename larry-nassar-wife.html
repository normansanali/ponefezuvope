As a result, Stephanie received sole custody of their three children and neither she nor the kids were present for Nassar's sentencing or court proceedings.</p><p>However, one of Nassar's patients, Trinea Gonczar, who attended the Nassars' wedding and was an avid supporter of the doctor until the trial invoked Stephanie when she testified in support of the victims.
