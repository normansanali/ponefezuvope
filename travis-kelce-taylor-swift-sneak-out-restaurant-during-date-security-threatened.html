He went on to sink $6 million into a property that apparently has enhanced security features.</p><p>“Travis knows way more than I do, he had to completely move out of his house,” Jason said while appearing on The Big Podcast With Shaq. “People were just staying by his house.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Travis’ security apparently remains a threat, even at his new address. “And the first day he moved into the new house … [in] a gated community, somebody knocks on the back window of the house,” Jason went on to reveal.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time Jason expressed concerns for Travis and Taylor’s safety in the midst of all the attention around their romance. He echoed similar sentiments last October, <a href=#>admitting the new level of fame has been weird</a> for their whole family.</p><p>"It's certainly been weird, the level that it is now," Jason said at the time. "On one hand, I'm happy for my brother that he seems to be in a relationship that he's excited about, that he is genuine about. But there's another end of it where it's like, ‘Man, this is a lot.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So, on one hand, really, really happy for my brother and where he's at in his current situation with Taylor," he continued. "But on the other hand, there's some alarms sometimes with how over-in-pursuit people can be."</p><p>Despite the publicity, Taylor and Travis’ recent date night spotting is a sign they’re not going to let the attention stop them from enjoying their lives, especially each other’s company.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lpJbGrbvRZqqwoZaperS6xJqiZqelqXqzsdKtmK6qkaPBbrDUq6Cnn12ZrrWxjKycnK2insG6edOhqZ6ZpJq7prCO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-sneak-out-restaurant-during-date-security-threatened.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-sneak-out-restaurant-during-date-security-threatened.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-sneak-out-restaurant-during-date-security-threatened.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-sneak-out-restaurant-during-date-security-threatened.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-sneak-out-restaurant-during-date-security-threatened.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-sneak-out-restaurant-during-date-security-threatened.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hong-chau.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hong-chau.html>Watchmen Actress, Hong Chau Is Still Marked As Unmarried; Achieved Numerous Of Nomination From Downs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./thunthun-skittles-net-worth-188600.html>ThunThun Skittles Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./thunthun-skittles-net-worth-188600.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
