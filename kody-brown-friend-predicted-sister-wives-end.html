In the show, which centers around a family who lives a life of polygamy, audiences have become familiar with Kody Brown, his four wives, and their combined 18 children. While the family maintained their loyalty to plural marriage for many years, there were people in their lives who didn't support their marriages.</p><p>At one point in time, the wives and Kody were confronted by someone at a mutual event who held a very strong stance on the life choices that the family had adopted and voiced his displeasure while on camera. This individual challenged Kody with an idea that ultimately panned out. Did he predict the future of the Sister Wives family with his input? Or did Kody's behavior of not defending his family cause the outcome?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-everyone-was-impressed-with-kody-brown-39-s-polygamist-lifestyle>Not Everyone Was Impressed With Kody Brown's Polygamist Lifestyle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screen-shot-2020-03-09-at-5-07-57-am-1.png><p>The beginning of the Sister Wives series saw the family fleeing from their shared home in Utah amid arrest rumors that they would be prosecuted for their chosen lifestyle.
