Nick is currently the president of the Jubilee Candy Corp. Maria explained that her dad got his start in the sweets industry because her grandfather owned a chocolate factory,</p><p>“So, growing up, all I heard was like my dad’s Willy Wonka, which is so funny. I love it, but they sold the business and my dad ventured out and did something on his own, which was sprinkles,” Maria said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> explaining her dad’s intriguing career, adding, “Yeah, he looks like a rock star but he’s a candy man.”</p><p>According to Nick’s <a href=#>LinkedIn</a> page, he began helping out with the business at a young age.

It was really bad. It’s crazy to even think about,” she said during the February episode. “My car seat was in, like, pieces. I was literally announced dead at the scene. It was in newspapers as a miracle at the time. It was a very scary situation.”</p><p>Maria explained to Joey that her mom went through a “big depression” after the accident and was not around much during her childhood. While their relationship is still strained, Maria admitted that her dad had advocated for the women to strengthen their bond.</p><p>“My mom and I are still a work in progress,” she said. “It’s been so much better. She thought you were so cute and she’s going to be excited to hopefully meet you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XrqS0xKWmq2Wjmq60u81maXFlk6S7tbHSrZinrF2irrO1wGaenqeinK60ecWapKKkqWK0trXDnmY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-bachelor-season-28-contestant-maria-georgas-family-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-bachelor-season-28-contestant-maria-georgas-family-guide.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-bachelor-season-28-contestant-maria-georgas-family-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-bachelor-season-28-contestant-maria-georgas-family-guide.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-bachelor-season-28-contestant-maria-georgas-family-guide.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-bachelor-season-28-contestant-maria-georgas-family-guide.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aew-house-shows-drawing-embarrassing-numbers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aew-house-shows-drawing-embarrassing-numbers.html>AEW House Shows Drawing Embarrassing Numbers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jessica-pegula-husband-taylor-gahagen.html>Who is Jessica Pegula's husband: Taylor Gahagen</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jessica-pegula-husband-taylor-gahagen.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
